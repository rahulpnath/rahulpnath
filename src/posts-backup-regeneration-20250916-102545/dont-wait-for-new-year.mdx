_I dislocated my shoulder on 2020 New Years Day._

Not the best start to the New Year, and COVID made it even worse. It would have been devastating if I had been waiting to be 2020 to kick start many New Year resolutions. The bad start would just have been another reason for inaction.

We wait for the New Year to make life-changing habits; for smaller ones, we wait for Monday; for everything else, we wait for Tomorrow.

> _You don't need a New Year or a Monday or a Tomorrow. Start Now._

Even though it wasn't the perfect start, 2020 was good in many other ways. I crossed my first 1000 YouTube subscribers, monetized my channel, and received the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award. For the first half of the year, I did miss out on running and cycling but slowly made back into it by mid of year.

I do Yearly Goals (now trying Quarterly Goals), but I have not been into this whole New Year Resolution setting. I feel it's overrated and designed to fail. Starting with more than one new habit on a particular day, to me, is a recipe for failure.

If you want to change something in your life, _**Start now.**_

The very least you can do is plan the next immediate step that needs to be done for whatever you want to do. Lock that into your calendar. Set a reminder.

Start Small, Start Today, Start Now.
