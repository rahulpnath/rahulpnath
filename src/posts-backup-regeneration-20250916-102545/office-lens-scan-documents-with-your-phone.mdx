Scanning physical documents can be cumbersome using a scanner, especially if you do not have easy access to one. Taking pictures with the default camera application on the phone might not give the best of results that you are expecting. Also, you will mostly end up needing to trim such photos of unwanted elements.

Microsoft Office Lens is the perfect application for scanning documents and whiteboards. Office Lens focuses documents in the camera frame and allows you to capture just what is required. It enhances the selected document sections. Below is an example of the highlight and the captured document.
