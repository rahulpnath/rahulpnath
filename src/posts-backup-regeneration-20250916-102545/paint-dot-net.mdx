For my blog's I often have to edit, resize, modify images often. The default paint application with Windows lacks a lot of features while [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop.html) is too advanced for my needs. [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html) is a freely available tool with many advanced features and is lightweight.

> _Paint.NET is free image and photo editing software for PCs that run Windows. It features an intuitive and innovative user interface with support for layers, unlimited undo, special effects, and a wide variety of useful and powerful tools_

In addition to the basic features expected off an image editing tool, paint.net supports layers, create special effects with unlimited history/undo. It also includes gradient tool, Magic Wand, Clone Stamp, etc. for advanced editing. Every action performed on the image is recorded in the History window and allows undoing.

[Download](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) the latest version of paint.net for free.
