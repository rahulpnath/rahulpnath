excerpt: A short recap of the year that is gone by and looking forward!
---
[Another year](/blog/2019-recap/) has gone by so fast, and it is again time to do a year review.

2020 has pushed us into new ways of living with COVID. I am grateful and lucky that I am in Australia, as it was least affected this year, and I hope it continues and stays the same.

> **TLDR;**  
> 2020 has been a year of the 'new normal.' I became more active on YouTube and continued with blogging. Reading and Tri-Sports didn't go as planned. Looking forward to 2021.

## What went well

### YouTube

Building out a niche for myself is something [I wanted to do this year.](/blog/2019-recap/#goals-for-2020) I started doing this with my YouTube channel. The goal was to publish three videos every month while also concentrating on a particular topic.

I published [40 videos and one YouTube Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/c/RahulNath/videos) during the last year! I concentrated on content around Azure DevOps and ASP NET Core. The channel got special mentions by [Scott Hanselman](https://twitter.com/ToughToWatch/status/1320988054421725185?s=20), [David Fowler](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1321086106742317059?s=20), in the [ASP NET Community Standup](https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/1306356354521600000) and a lot more people. I am grateful and excited for this.

I crossed the 4000 watch hours and 1000 subscribers around August, and since then, the channel is getting me money enough to buy a coffee a day. It is my first step towards passive income, and I hope to grow this in the coming years.

### Blogging

Blogging took a bit of the backseat, with most of my focus being on YouTube. I published 25 posts (including this one) over 2020. The blogs were across different topics around DevOps, .NET, Azure, JavaScript, and Productivity.

I am still happy that I could write two posts on average each month, with so much going around the YouTube channel.

Towards the last couple of months, [Parvathy](https://www.facebook.com/parvathy.panicker) (my wife) started helping me with editing the videos. It gave me a lot more time to try other things. I took a full day **Masterclass Course** at work on Azure DevOps and also did a [**talk at Microsoft User Group Hyderabad on Azure DevOps**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mugh-azure-devops-day-2020-tickets-132647368851#)

### Microsoft MVP

I received my first [Microsoft MVP Award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) in the Azure category to recognize my community contributions and technical leadership. The YouTube channel and this blog have played a significant role in helping me get the award. I thank you all for making it possible.

I started a **Newsletter** focused on Productivity tips, tools, books, etc. You can [check it out here](https://rahulpnath.substack.com/) and please do Subscribe if you are interested.

## What didn't go well

-   **Tri Sports** I started this year with a 10k run. But later that day, I slipped at the park while playing with Gautham (my son) and [dislocated my shoulder](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6xdJvXDbyH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). It was a slow recovery from the injury and mostly limited to running and cycling. I have still not tried swimming after the injury. I ran over 350+ km and 400+ km on cycle, but way less than my previous years. I am looking to get back into it in 2021.
-   **Learning and Reading** I had set a goal of reading 12 books but could only get to 5. However, I am happy to have done the [Building a Second Brain Course](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) by Tiago on Personal Knowledge Management. The course has changed the way I consume information online. I am slowly building out my Personal Knowledge Management System. I have started taking [notes when reading books and blog articles.](/blog/why-i-chose-diigo/)
-   **Travel** With COVID happening, it was a year with almost no travel. I am lucky to be in Australia as we could freely move around, at least most of the time. Except for a few day trips to the beaches and parks nearby, there was not much travel. I hope next year the situation becomes better.

## Goals for 2021

This year I'm trying something different with my Goal setting. Rather than having a few very high-level Areas for the whole year, I will be breaking the high-level areas into Quarterly goals. Focus for 2021 is to Improve my **Fitness**, **Grow my Audience**, **Learning** and **Improving Family Experience**.

I have broken this further down into Quarterly Goals following the [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). Each Goal has a set of associated Ideas. These are the ways I think I can achieve the Goal.

> Check out my [**December Newsletter**](https://rahulpnath.substack.com/p/december-newsletter) if you want to learn more about Goal Setting!

Some of my main Goals or Key Results for the first quarter of 2021 are

-   Run a Half Marathon in less than 2 hours and Cycle a 100km course in Zwift
-   Gain 2.5k [YouTube Subscribers](https://www.youtube.com/user/rahulnathp/?sub_confirmation=1) and 200 Twitter followers
-   Pre-launch an Online Course
-   Complete '[The Art of Reading](https://alexbooks.podia.com/the-art-of-reading)' Course, Read two books and publish Summaries.
-   Buy and Move to House

I currently manage my Areas of Focus, Goals, and Ideas in [Notion](http://notion.so/) as a table. I still do [Bullet Journaling](/blog/bullet-journaling/), but maintain it in Notion instead of a physical journal.

![Areas, SMART Goals, and Ideas on how to achieve them - All managed in Notion](/images/q1_2021_goals.jpg)

I am aiming high here with these Goals and would be happy to hit 80% of them. I will do a follow-up review towards the end of March 2021 and see where I stand with these Objectives and Goals.

Wishing you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year!
