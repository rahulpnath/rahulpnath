I have been working on Microsoft stack for over a long time, in fact almost my entire career. Now that with all the platforms out there and cross platform being a very important factor in any application development, knowing about other platforms and developing for them is very important . Since I have had some prior experience on Java, I thought of ramping back on it so that I could also explore the Android operating system.

Setting up Java and choosing an [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) was always confusing for me and so is it now. For .Net it was, is and always will be [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) and the setup experience is seamless. For a person in the .net world moving into java would take some time in setting up the environment, and getting used to the IDE’s. Personally I feel that none of the java IDE’s matches the experience and features provided by Visual Studio - but that might be just me. But lets be happy with what we have and start setting up our development environment.

-   **Download** the [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). I have chosen to download the latest one as on writing this blog, as I did not have any reason not to. If you have a specific need to have a particular java version then you should get that. Install it into the appropriate location (e.g. _C:\\Program Files\\java\\jdk1.7_)
-   **Set JAVA\_HOME** in the system environment variables. Right Click on MyComputer –> Properties –>Advanced System Settings –> Environment Variables Under System Variables, add a new variable by clicking New and entering _Variable Name \_as JAVA\_HOME and \_Variable value_ as the path to the root jdk folder installed in previous step.(_C:\\Program Files\\java\\jdk1.7_). Save the changes. To see if this has been saved you can verify by opening a command prompt and typing in \_echo %JAVA\_HOME%, \_which should echo out the path set above.
-   Update \*\*PATH \*\*to include java path too, so that this can be executed from anywhere, without knowing the full path of the java compiler. Under system variables there would already be a variable with name _path _(if not add it), to which you can append the java path. Java is in the bin folder under the root folder, so append “_;%JAVA\_HOME%/bin;_” to the path variable. Save and close. To check if this is successfully setup, open up command prompt and type in java. You should see usage information help for java.
-   \*\*Installing ANT. \*\*Download [ant library](http://ant.apache.org/) and copy/install into a suitable location. Ant is used in the build of java applications and is more comparable to msbuild in .net.
-   Set \*\*ANT\_HOME **and** PATH \*\*like we set for Java. Should be easy for you now.
-   Download and install [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
-   Set \*\*ANDROID\_HOME \*\*to the android sdk root folder.
-   Set \*\*PATH \*_for android tools(_%ANDROID\_HOME%\\tools;_) and platform-tools_(%ANDROID\_HOME%\\platform-tools;\*)
-   **Download an IDE**. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) , [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) are all freely available IDE’s that you can choose from. Android studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA. I chose to use IntelliJ for now for no specific reason.

Now you are all setup for starting your development with PhoneGap on Android . Hope this helps you to quick start your development.
