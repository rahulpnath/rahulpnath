Hey, it's Rahul. I am a software engineer, currently working in Brisbane, Australia. Thank you for reading my blog and checking out more about me as a person. I am the guy (on the left) in the above picture and next to me is my wife Parvathy. The little guy is my son Gautham.

I currently work with [Oztix](https://www.oztix.com.au/).
