When it comes to mobile phones, I used to be a gadget freak and buy the latest phone as soon as it arrives in the market. But not after I got the [Nexus 5](/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/). It's been well over three years now and not even once did I want to switch over to something else. The phone never slowed down over these years, and the battery lasted enough for the day. I broke the Nexus screen a couple of months back and was forced to switch over to a new phone. I didn't have to do much market research or phone comparisons this time; as I just knew which one to pick up.

[The Pixel, Phone By Google!](https://madeby.google.com/intl/en_au/phone/)

<Figure src="/images/pixel.png" caption="## Key Features" />

The Pixel is the first phone in the Google Pixel hardware line and is a successor to the Nexus range of devices. The Pixel runs [Android-Nougat](https://www.android.com/intl/en_au/versions/nougat-7-0/) with some features exclusive to it. The Pixel is very much comparable to the Nexus, with improved hardware and latest software. Below are some of the key features that I like about the phone.

-   **Fingerprint sensor** The fingerprint sensor on the back allows you to unlock the phone and specific apps and also authorize purchases. [1Password](/blog/password-manager-get-one-if-you-havent-already/) is integrated with the sensor which enables me to unlock it using the sensor. I no longer need to type in my long master password every time I use 1Password.
-   **Camera** _Pixel takes brilliant photos in bright light, low light, and any light._ The camera is awesome and at times is a good replacement for your [DSLR](/blog/photography-learning-to-click/). With Pixel, Google also provides unlimited original quality storage for all photos and videos.
-   **Google Assistant** Pixel is the first phone with the [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/) built-in. It helps you manage tasks, find content on phone and the internet, perform actions, etc. just like Siri or Cortana. I have not used the assistant much and yet to find some valid use cases.

#### **Apps**

Some of the apps that I use regularly are

#### \*\*Case \*\*

I am using the [Spigen Neo Hybrid](/blog/spigen-awesome-phone-cases/) case for Pixel. It adds extra weight to the phone, but I am used to it from my Nexus as well. The Neo Hybrid provides military grade protection and protects the phone from most falls.

Overall I have found the Pixel a good phone and recommend it to anyone looking out for a new phone now. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is also of the same range (slightly costlier) and worth considering if you are not too particular about having a vanilla Android experience. Which phone do you use?
