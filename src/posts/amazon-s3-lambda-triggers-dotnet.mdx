Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that allows you to store any data.

Any time an object is created or modified in S3, it raises event notifications. We can use these notifications in specific scenarios to perform additional business logic or application processing.

For example - When a user uploads a profile picture image, we can store the file in S3 storage and use event notifications when the file is written to process them as thumbnails and other formats. We can also use event notifications to process large data files uploaded for bulk processing.

S3 Event Notification Types and Destinations
--------------------------------------------

Amazon S3 supports notifications for different types and destinations to publish these events. When configuring event notification triggers, you can specify the event types and the destination for the events.

### Notification Types

Below are the [Notification Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/notification-how-to-event-types-and-destinations.html#supported-notification-event-types) supported by Amazon S3.

*   **s3:TestEvent →** Test notification event created when notification is enabled on S3
*   **s3:ObjectCreated: →** Object created or updated events. The \* can also be replaced by _PUT_, _POST_, or _COPY_ if you want to listen to specific operations on S3.
*   **s3:ObjectRemoved: →** Objects are removed from S3. The \* can be replaced by _Delete_ or _DeleteMarkerCreated._

### Event Destinations

Amazon S3 can send event notifications to different destinations. Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon EventBridge are currently supported destinations. When setting up the destinations, we can specify the notification types to be sent to the particular destination.

Build and Deploy .NET Lambda Function
-------------------------------------

[AWS Lambda](__GHOST_URL__/blog/aws-lambda-net-core/) is Amazon’s answer to serverless computing services. It allows running code with zero administration of the infrastructure that the code is running on.

Make sure to install the AWS Toolkit ([Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/), [Rider](https://aws.amazon.com/rider/), [VS Code](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/)) and [set up Credentials for the local development environment](__GHOST_URL__/blog/amazon-credentials-dotnet/).  This helps you quickly develop a .NET application on the AWS infrastructure and deploy them quickly to your AWS Accounts.

AWS Lambda For The .NET Developer: How To Easily Get Started

Learn how to get started with AWS Lambda with .NET Core by building out a simple function and deploying to AWS. We will also see how to set up local development environment using the AWS Toolkit.

With the AWS Toolkit installed, select the AWS Lambda Lambda Project template from the new project template and choose the S3 blueprint. This creates an AWS Lambda function template project with a `Function.cs` class with everything required to handle S3 events, as shown below.

    public class Function
    {
        public async Task<string?> FunctionHandler(S3Event evnt, ILambdaContext context)
        {
            var s3Event = evnt.Records?[0].S3;
            if(s3Event == null)
            {
                return null;
            }
    
            try
            {
                var response = await this.S3Client.GetObjectMetadataAsync(s3Event.Bucket.Name, s3Event.Object.Key);
                            context.Logger.LogInformation(response.Headers.ContentType);
                return response.Headers.ContentType;
            }
            catch(Exception e)
            {
                context.Logger.LogInformation($"Error getting object {s3Event.Object.Key} from bucket {s3Event.Bucket.Name}. Make sure they exist and your bucket is in the same region as this function.");
                context.Logger.log information(e.Message);
                context.Logger.log information(e.StackTrace);
                throw;
            }
        }
    }
    

The `S3Event` class represents the S3 event notification and contains the S3 object information and associated metadata for the event.

### Deploy Lambda Function

To publish the Lambda function to the AWS account, you can use the Publish to AWS Lambda option that the AWS Toolkit provides. You can directly publish the new lambda function with your [development environment connected to your AWS account](__GHOST_URL__/blog/amazon-credentials-dotnet/).

I prefer to set up an automated build/deploy pipeline to publish to your AWS Account for real-world applications. Check out the below for an example of how to set up a Lambda Function deployment pipeline from GitHub Actions.

Setting Up S3 Notification and Lambda Trigger
---------------------------------------------

With the Lambda Function deployed, we can set up the function to trigger on S3 event notifications.

You can do this under the Lambda Function or the S3 Bucket for which you want to listen to the notifications.

Under the Lambda Function, navigate to Configuration → Triggers and choose the ‘Add Tigger’ button (as shown below).

![Add Trigger from the Lambda Function under Configuration → Triggers. This allows to choose different sources for the Lambda Trigger, and one of them is S3.](/images/s3-add-lambda-trigger.jpg)

Add Trigger from the Lambda Function under Configuration → Triggers. This allows you to choose different sources for the Lambda Trigger, and one of them is S3.

It prompts us to select the Source of the trigger. Select S3 and specify the source Bucket (`user-contact-data` in this case).

Select the event types that you want to trigger Lambda Function.

Below I’ve selected ‘All object create events, which will trigger on create, update, copy, and multipart uploads of objects to the S3.

![Select S3 and Lambda Trigger source and select the S3 Bucket that serves as the event source. Specify the event types for which to trigger the .NET Lambda Function](/images/s3-add-lambda-trigger-create.jpg)

When adding the Trigger, the S3 is permitted to invoke the Lambda Function. This is required so that any time an S3 notification occurs, it can invoke the Lambda Function with the Object details.

The permission added can be seen under the ‘Resource-based policy’ section under the Lambda Function Configuration → Permissions, as shown below.

![The resource-based policy allows S3 to invoke the .NET Lambda Function on a notification.](/images/s3-trigger-lambda-invoke-permission.jpg)

### IAM Policies

Since the Lambda Function uses the `AmazonS3Client` to read the Object metadata on processing the event notification, we need to ensure the Lambda function has the appropriate permissions to talk to S3.

For this, we can edit Lambda’s IAM Role and add an inline policy with the `GetObject` read permission on the S3 storage.

![Update the Lambda IAM Permissions to talk to the S3 Bucket. To read the file data and the metadata, assign the GetObject Read access.](/images/s3-lambda-iam-permissions.jpg)

### Testing Integration

Upload a new file to the S3 Bucket to test the end-to-end integration. This triggers an S3 notification, which is sent to the Lambda Function.

On receiving the notification, Lambda functions use the `AmazonS3Client` to get the newly added object's metadata and log it to CloudWatch.

If required, you can update the Function handler code to read the file's contents, as shown below.

    var file = await this.S3Client.GetObjectAsync(s3Event.Bucket.Name, s3Event.Object.Key);
    using var reader = new StreamReader(file.ResponseStream);
    var fileContents = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
    
    context.Logger.LogInformation(fileContents);
    

The file contents can be used for business processing or other application-related functionality in a real-world scenario.

Lambda Trigger Configuration
----------------------------

The Lambda Configuration supports two additional configuration properties - Prefix and Suffix. Both are optional.

*   Prefix → Limits the notifications to objects with names starting with the specified characters.
*   Suffix → Limits the notifications to objects with names ending with the specified characters.

![S3 Lambda Trigger configuration to specify the Prefix or Suffix, to filter the files sent to Lambda Function.](/images/s3-add-lambda-trigger-configuration.jpg)

In the above screenshot, I have Prefix as ‘_unprocessed/_’, which means only S3 Objects uploaded to the folder _unprocessed,_ will trigger a notification of the Lambda Function.

Specifying the Prefix and Suffix is particularly useful if you are reading/writing back to the same S3 Bucket from the same Lambda Function. This otherwise would cause a recursive invocation of the Lambda Function. Using Prefix, you can trigger the Lambda Function only when a file is changed under a specific filter (being under the unprocessed folder). You can write back the new file to a different folder that does not fall under the original filter condition.

E.g., Suppose we are processing images using the Lambda Function. When they are uploaded to the ‘unprocessed’ folder, you can write back the processed image to a different folder (’processed’) so that it will not trigger the Lambda function again.

S3 Notification and Exception Handling
--------------------------------------

Amazon S3 invokes Lambda Function asynchronously. This means the Lambda Function does not wait for a response from the Function code. S3 hands off the notification message, and Lambda is responsible for the rest.

As long as the messages get processed successfully, things go okay. But it’s when messages fail to process (which can happen for various reasons), we need to do additional configuration.

### Simulating Exception in .NET Lambda

To simulate an exception in processing in our simple S3 Lambda Handler, let’s add a condition on the S3 Object name.

If the file name contains the word ‘Exception,’ the function handler will throw an exception. This makes it easy to simulate an exception condition.

    public async Task<string?> FunctionHandler(S3Event event, ILambdaContext context)
    {
        var s3Event = evnt.Records?[0].S3;
        if (s3Event == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
    
        if (s3Event.Object.Key.Contains("Exception"))
            throw new Exception($"Exception processing file {s3Event.Object.Key}");
    
       ... //Remaining Processing
    }
    

If we upload a file with a name that contains ‘Exception’, the Lambda function will fail to process the notification message.

### Default Retry Behaviour

By default, Lambda retires the message two times on an exception when processing the message asynchronously.

This is configured under Configuration → Asynchronous invocation section.

It also specified the maximum age of the event as 6 hours, which means the message will be discarded after that time if not processed.

![Lambda Asynchronous configuration sets the message retry limit and the maximum age event.](/images/s3-lambda-asynchronous-invocation-configuration.jpg)

So for an Object uploaded with ‘Exception’ in the name, we will see the message processed by the Lambda Function 3 times - 1 on the notification + 2 retries. The first retry is after 1 minute of the original notification and then 2 minutes after the first retry.

If the notification's processing errors are due to transient errors (which go away with time), it might get processed the second time. But for errors that aren’t transient (like in our case, since it will always error if the file name has the word ‘Exception’), it will retry two times and then be discarded. The notification will be lost.

### Lambda Asynchronous Invocation Configuration

To prevent notifications from being lost after two retries, we can update the Asynchronous configuration and specify a Dead-letter queue (DLQ).

Any unprocessed messages after the specified number of Retry attempts (0, 1, or 2) will be automatically moved to the specified Dead Letter Queue.

The DLQ can be Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS. Below I have configured it to be an SQS.

![Update the Lambda Asynchronous Configuration to set up the Dead Letter Queue. Any messages that cannot be processed after the specified number of retries is moved to the DLQ](/images/s3-lambda-asynchronous-invocation-configuration-edit.jpg)

Any notifications that have already been discarded before updating this configuration are permanently lost. New notifications that cannot be processed after two retries will be moved to the SQS.

Based on the message and your business needs, you can reprocess these messages by addressing the error in processing.

I hope this helps you to understand and set up Lambda Triggers based on S3 Object notifications.
