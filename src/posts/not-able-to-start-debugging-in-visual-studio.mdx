![visual studio debug not working](/images/vs_debug_not_working.png)

Quite a few days back,I faced a peculiar problem :).Visual Studio was not having the green play button(the one for Start Debugging) enabled.No way was I able to start debugging. Google gave many suggestions,none was of help. I soon found out that,in Startup Projects(From the menu Project -> Properties),the option multiple was selected and all the projects were set to an action None)(Setting this to Start Without debugging also creates this same problem) :)

Yet to find out how this happened automatically but still setting up the startup project,made the green button glow :)

Be sure to check this the next time if the green button doesn't glow :)
