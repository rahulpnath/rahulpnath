After a long time after my first microsoft certification,[70-536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-536),.NET Framework - Application Development Foundation today i have taken the certification for WPF, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Windows Presentation Foundation Application Development,[70-502](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-502&locale=en-us).  
This one is easy for anyone who has some hands on experience in WPF.One has to be familiar with the different panels and layout,Binding,Styles and Templates.Other than that some knowledge on click once deployment would also be of help.  
The best way to prepare for this,would be to have a visual studio up and running and try out different things on WPF.  
I would suggest the books [Sams WPF Unleashed](http://www.pearson.ch/Informatik/SamsPublishing/1449/9780672328916/Windows-Presentation-Foundation.aspx) and [Pro WPF](http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781590599556) to start with.Both are really helpful.Apart from that check out the various blogs and forums out there.Just google and you would find a hell lot of those,just like you found this one:)  
Just gonna relax the day ahead after the hard earned certification :):)
