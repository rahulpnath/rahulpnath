excerpt: Do you enter your git credentials very often?

If you are wondering what Git Credential Manager (GCM) is, then possibly you see the below screen very often when you are interacting with your git repositories.

On Windows, you can use [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows) which integrates with git and provides the credentials whenever required. GCM removes the need for you to enter the credentials when using the git repositories.

[Cmder](/blog/cmder-portable-console-emulator-for-windows/) is a portable console emulator for Windows. I prefer to use git from the command line and find the cmder experience good. Check out the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpxx8hlNTzc) for more details.

To set up GCM with Cmder download the [latest release of GCM](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases) in the zip format. Unzip the package under the _vendor_ folder in cmder. Run the _install.cmd_ from within the unzipped GCM package.

Once you run the install script, the git config will be updated to use the credential manager. Running _git config --list_ will show the _credential.helper_ set to _manager_. If this is not automatically set you can set it manually by running

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager

```

For GUI prompts for entering credentials use

```bash
git config --global credential.modalprompt true

```

Hope that saves you some time if you were entering the credentials every time you push/pull from a git repository.
