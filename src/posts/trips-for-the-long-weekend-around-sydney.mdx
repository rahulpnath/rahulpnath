A while back I had written about various [one-day trip options around Sydney](/posts/one-day-trips-around-sydney/). Here is a list of places that we traveled around Sydney during long weekend breaks with a day or two overnight stays.

> [**TLDR;**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read)

*   [Coffs Harbour](/posts/three-day-trip-to-coffs-harbour-from-sydney/)
*   [Port Macquarie](https://www.portmacquarieinfo.com.au/)
*   [Grand Pacific Drive](http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/)
*   [Blue Mountains](https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains?nst=0)
*   [Canberra](https://visitcanberra.com.au/)

### [Coffs Harbour](/posts/three-day-trip-to-coffs-harbour-from-sydney/)

[Coffs Harbour](/posts/three-day-trip-to-coffs-harbour-from-sydney/) is one of the places that I liked the most of all my trips. It's been almost a year since I made my trip and the memories are still fresh. The beaches are great, especially the Jetty Beach. The rainforest walk in Dorrigo was the best I have had to date, especially because of the rain the night before. Coffs Harbour is perfect for a 3-4 days trip and there are a lot of places to visit around.

### [Port Macquarie](https://www.portmacquarieinfo.com.au/)

We headed off to Port Macquarie to celebrate Gauthams birthday. Gautham likes strawberries a lot which was why we chose Port Macquarie. [Ricardoes Tomatoes & Strawberries](http://www.ricardoes.com/) is located just ten minutes north of Port Macquarie and provides a unique experience for picking your own strawberries. You can spend around 2-3 hours here and make sure you don't miss the scones from the cafe. Port Macquarie is also a great place for whale watching and we headed off on an early morning trip to be with the whales. The boat ride ([PortJet](https://www.portjet.com.au/)) in itself is an experience and to our luck, we were able to see around 3 whales up close. We also went to Dooragan National Park, Kattang, Perpendicular Point and Charles Hamsey lookout.

### [Grand Pacific Drive](http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/)

The Grand Pacific Drive makes a great one day trip as well as a multi-day trip for those who want to take their time along this stretch of land. Starting from Royal National Park and stretching all the way to Sapphire Coast, this makes a great drive with beautiful scenery and also a lot of places to visit. The [Grand Pacific Drive](http://www.grandpacificdrive.com.au/) site has all the details that you need to plan your trip. It also has a trip planner that makes planning easier. If you want to cover most of the places along the way during a single trip, it is best to give it 2-3 days. During my trip, I stopped over at Wollongong and only made my way till Kiama.

### [Blue Mountains](https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains?nst=0)

Just 90 minutes from Sydney by car, the Blue Mountains has a lot of attractions worth visiting, making it a good place for an extended weekend trip. Wentworth Falls, Echo Point, and Three Sisters are some of the popular lookouts. [Scenic World](https://www.scenicworld.com.au/) offers some good rides and entertainment for kids. I liked the worlds steepest incline railway ride in particular. The entry tickets are a bit overpriced though.

Jenolan Caves is another one hour drive from the Blue Mountains and is a must-do. It's great for people of all ages and if you have kids they will love it. Make sure you check the different [cave options](http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/) and choose one that fits the people in your group. Booking a spot in advance might help and make sure you arrive on time. The drive up there might be a bit slower so give enough buffer time before your cave walk starts.

### [Canberra](https://visitcanberra.com.au/)

Unlike Sydney, Canberra is a planned city and you can tell that from the moment you enter it. It's a beautiful little city with lots of variety of things to visit. We started off with the [Cockington Green Gardens](https://www.cockingtongreen.com.au/) followed by the [National Dinosaur museum](http://nationaldinosaurmuseum.com.au/). You can spend almost half a day with these and try out the [Hamlet, Food Trucks](https://visitcanberra.com.au/eat-and-drink/57031e8c5d234a7604ea80b2/the-hamlet). The [Parliment House](https://www.aph.gov.au/Visit_Parliament) and [Australian War Memorial](https://www.awm.gov.au/) is also worth visiting. If you time your visit during September-October you can also see the [Floriade](https://visitcanberra.com.au/events/56b23aea266140594567dbbe/floriade) - the tulip flower festival.

Nelson Bay, Hunter Valley, Orange, Port Stephens etc are some of the places that are on our list but could not make it yet. I moved over to Brisbane end of last year and not sure when I will have another chance to explore more around Sydney. But I have new places to look forward to now - Exploring Brisbane!
