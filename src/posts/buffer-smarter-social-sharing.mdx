Posts on this blog are published automatically on preset dates. I have created a custom workflow for this in Octopress, my blogging framework. If you are interested in the end to end workflow check out my [video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTjHWjepag). Publishing to different social media was also one of the things that I wanted to automate in the whole workflow. So whenever a post is published to my blog, it also posts to the different social media (Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn).

[Buffer](https://buffer.com/) is a tool to manage all your social media networks and publish content to it at one. It is a '_Write Once, Publish Everywhere_' kind of service and works best for me. From the Buffer website or using [browser extensions](https://buffer.com/extensions) posts can be manually buffered. A buffered post can be published immediately, scheduled to be shared next or scheduled for a particular date and time. You can have custom messages for each of the social network that you are sharing.

For automatic updates from my blog, I use [Buffer via Email](https://buffer.com/guides/email). With every buffer account, there is an associated email address. A post can be buffered by sending an email to this address in a specific format. So every time a new blog is published I send an email to my buffer account to publish immediately (@postnow). Automatic sharing posts also helps me reduce the time I spend on social networks; [learning to disconnect](__GHOST_URL__/blog/life-learnings-after-being-a-parent/)

I am on their [Free plan](https://buffer.com/pricing) at present. I have only less than ten posts scheduled at any point in time, and the plan provides all the features I need.

Hope this helps you manage your social media content.
