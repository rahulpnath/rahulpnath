Hi, Many a times while using listbox,listview etc there might be a need to delete the multiple selected items. This can be easily achieved by the following piece of code

     While ControlName.SelectedItems.Count &gt; 0 
       ControlName.Items.Remove(ControlName.SelectedItem)
    End While
    

Happy Coding :)
