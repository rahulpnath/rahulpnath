_I hate change._

When I left my first job, I had to move cities. But I ended up quitting my new job in 3 days (2 days and 3 hours, to be exact) because I couldn't handle all the changes. I went back to my old friends, house, and routines. It's then I realized how much I took comfort in unchanging conditions.

_But soon, I realized without change, there is no growth._

> "_The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new._" - Dan Millman

Embrace change if you want to grow in life.

Knowing myself and how much I dislike change, I now use different tactics to force change. Here are some examples of how I do it.

Starting with this online course, Ship30Fo30 is one such example. I mostly wrote 'How To' category articles on my blog. But now, with these Essays, I am forcing myself to try new formats, styles, and methods of writing.

Publishing my Yearly/Quarterly Goals on my blog forces me to be more accountable. I trick my brain into thinking there are people now watching me (even though there are none.)

Signing up for running and cycling events forces me to stay fit. The last thing I want is to show up on a race day and not complete it.

If you want to do something, find ways to force yourself into it. Find ways to make yourself accountable - force change. Sometimes you might fail; who cares? You still grow.

To Change is Permanent.
