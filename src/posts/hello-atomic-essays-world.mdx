I am a programmer, so let's start with a Hello World for Atomic Essays!

First things first, **What is an Atomic Essay?**

Atomic Essays are single ideas expressed in under 250 words

That's simple, so **Why am I doing this?**

I have been blogging for over 10 years and mostly in the '_How To_' category of posts. With Atomic Essays, I am looking to explore a bit more of my own thoughts, opinions, and experiences and share them with you.

Mmm, sounds interesting, so **What am I going to write about?**

Drawing from my experiences as a Consultant, Programmer, Blogger, and Youtuber, I will write about Developer Life, Productivity, and Building a Personal Brand. To spice it up, I'll also write about maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the importance of exercise, and how I lost over 25 kilos in the past couple of years.

Sounds exciting, but **How will I keep my ideas flowing?**

I have set up a few Content Buckets based on the General, Niche, and Industry audience that I want to write for. Using these as a guideline, I have set up an Idea Log. This should help me keep going ðŸ¤ž.

Great, **Where will I publish these ideas?**

I will publish this on Twitter [@rahulpnath](https://twitter.com/rahulpnath) as images and plan to cross publish this on my blog(for a more accessible text version).

If this sounds interesting, make sure to follow my journey.ðŸš€
