With all banks stopping on EMI(Equated Monthly Installment),with recession at its high,I was left with no choice for a long time,but to depend on internet cafe's,as my compaq V2624TU got some hardware problems and wouldn't start up.Blogging was on the verge of stopping.....thanks to my brother,Sagar,who turned my new banker for the brand new HP DV4.

Thanks a lot bro :)

Got to start saving though,for always bankers might not be there nor will EMI's(they really helped for my previous purchases).  
Hoping to make it a resolution(you always want something's to be broken),for the year 2010.

Happy New Year :)
