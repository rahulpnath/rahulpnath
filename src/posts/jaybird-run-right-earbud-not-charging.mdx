A few months back, I got a used Jaybird run headphones to listen to music while running. I enjoy running with those, and they are a perfect fit. It has never dropped off during my runs. However, after a couple of weeks, the right earbuds stopped charging. Here are a few tips that help me get it charged every time - yes need to do one of these or even a combination to get it to charge every time I pop them back on the case.

-   Remove the ear tips and open/close lots of times until it decides to charge
-   Clean the tips and the charging case points with an earbud
-   Blow hard into the small gap in the charging case, where the lid locks in. I assume this is happening because of dust accumulating inside the case. Doing this fixes the charging issue in one or two tries and has been the fastest way to get it to charge.

I love these earphones, but it's a pain to get them to charge - Hope this helps.
