I try to stay offline for fixed times during the day and often [prepare myself up for it](__GHOST_URL__/blog/staying-productive-offline/). Having things to read is one of the important things to it. [Feedly](__GHOST_URL__/blog/feedly-one-stop-reading-place/) allows to keep track of all the reading sources that I have, while I am online. Some articles need more time and focus to be well understood, and I often end up 'Saving them for Later.'

[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) is an app that helps manage articles that you wish to read later. You can save articles, videos or pretty much anything into Pocket and view them later. The best thing about Pocket is that on mobile devices, it allows offline reading - i.e., without the need for an internet connection.

Pocket has [apps and browser extensions](https://getpocket.com/add/?ep=1) for a variety of platforms making it easy to save articles that you find interesting. You can save to pocket while on your laptop or your mobile devices and have it available for later reading. Feedly integrates with Pocket and allows to save articles for future reading straight to Pocket. I am using the free version of Pocketand it works perfectly for me. But if you are interested in more advanced features you can upgrade to the [Premium version](https://getpocket.com/premium?ep=1).

Don't miss out on that article that you want to read (later), [Get Pocket](https://getpocket.com)!
