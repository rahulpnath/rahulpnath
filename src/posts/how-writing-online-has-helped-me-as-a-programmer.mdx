I have been a programmer for 14 years, of which I am writing online for 12 years.

Yes, my writing sucked, still sucks; I have not been consistent with it, and it's ok. Who cares? Don't let the perfect be the enemy of good enough. I've benefitted, even just by showing up now and then.

> Start to write first. Let's worry about everything else later.

-   **Resume** - Most of my online writing has been around my experiences, struggles, wins, what worked, what didn't, and my mistakes. It's a record of everything I've gone through in my work and personal life. It is my _Living Resume._
-   **Easy Knowledge Transfer** - Whenever I change projects or have someone new join my team, I have a list of blog posts ready for them to get started. I've had people reach out to me even months after leaving the project, thanking me for such articles.
-   **Google Myself** Yes, I google myself a lot of times. Being a software consultant many times, different clients have very similar problems. Referring to my own blogs makes it easy to reimplement them for a different client, even if it's month after I wrote about it.
-   **Personal Brand** It helped me build my voice and try different things. I now do videos on YouTube, freelance consulting, and am a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP). People often reach out to me for my thoughts and opinions. All of this started with writing.
