[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is a writing platform that helps you polish your writing. Grammarly scans your text for mistakes based on pre-written rules and suggests modifications. A detailed explanation is given on the suggestions made and helps improve your writing over a period.

> _Grammarly makes sure everything you type is clear, effective, and mistake-free._

With the [chrome plugin, Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en) is there everywhere that you write on the web. It hides away neatly to a corner without getting in the way of your writing.

You can author text either in the website, or have Grammarly watch your back as you type anywhere in Chrome with the plugin, integrate it with Microsoft Office or use the Windows app. Check out the [apps section](https://app.grammarly.com/apps) to get more details. You can try Grammarly for free and check for critical grammar and spelling mistakes. With the [premium version](https://www.grammarly.com/premium) you get a lot more features and grammar rules. Currently, I am on the premium version and recommend it.

Try [Grammarly for free](https://www.grammarly.com/i/personalize?install=true) and see if it helps you as well.
