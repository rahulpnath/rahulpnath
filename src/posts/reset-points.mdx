It's one of those lazy days where everything is slow, and nothing much happens. Sometimes this goes on for multiple days or weeks before I can get back on track. I feel like I have fallen behind and hard to get back on track.

_Finding a reset point is important to get back into the day._

> _A bad start to the day does not have to define the rest._

Not everything has to go as per plan, and that is ok. If we brood on with a bad start, then it's only going to get worse and can trickle over to the days ahead. Soon it will be weeks or months before you realize. This has happened to me in the past, and I need to find more reset points.

My Morning Routine is the only reset point I had until now. Recently I came across a video by my fellow shipper Matt Ragland which talks about finding different reset points throughout the day to get back on track if we slip off.

Today my reset point was writing this essay. It makes me happy to create and get a feeling of control.

I plan to build multiple reset points throughout my day. E.g., Walking Gautham to school, Â Ride the bike before lunch, Meditate for 5 mins, Brain Dump ideas for essays, etc.

The more intentional you are about the reset points, the easier it is to get back in control and avoid auto-pilot.

Reset and Stay in control.
