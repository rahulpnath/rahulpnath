Over the past couple of weeks, I have been trying to improve my focus while working. With [running (3 \_ 1.5 hours a week) and bodyweight training (3 \_ 30 minutes a week)](/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/) taking a significant part of my [morning routine](/blog/morning-routine/), I have less time for [blogging, learning, and videos](/blog/2016-recap/). Though I have known [The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for a long time, I never practiced it regularly. With less time and more things to get done, I badly had to do something to get back on track with everything and thought of giving it a try.

> _The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named Pomodoro_

Initially, I was looking at apps that can integrate with [Todoist](/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/), my task management tool. There are a lot of [pomodoro apps that integrate with Todoist](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/210762349-Pomodoro-with-Todoist), but I found all of them an overkill. [**Tomighty**](http://tomighty.org/) is a simple Pomodoro timer that just tracks time and settings for the Pomodoro interval and long and short breaks. It hides away well in the Notification area of the taskbar and shows the amount of time left in the current interval. It plays sounds when an interval starts and ends. You can interrupt a Pomodoro session and restart it if required. That is all that you need from a timer to keep up with the Pomodoro technique.

_If you are on a high DPI machine running Windows, the UI might not scale well. There is a [workaround](https://github.com/tomighty/tomighty/issues/115) for this._

Sticking to the Pomodoro Technique has been working well for me, and I am able to focus better on the task at hand. I am still exploring the technique and trying to improve on it. Do you use Pomodoro Technique? If you are new to Pomodoro Technique and want to learn more check out the book, [The Pomodoro Technique](http://amzn.to/2nCSZW1), by Francesco Cirillo, the creator of the technique.
