I lost 23 kilos over 6 months in 2017.

It all started with running once a week, which soon turned to be 3, cycling to work, eating healthier, cutting out on sugar, including more activities in family trips, etc. One small change triggered a domino effect in my life.

> _Healthy is an outfit that looks different on everybody._

Fast-forward 4 years, I am still at 75 kilos. Here's how things look for me now.

**Exercise**: Running and Cycling have become a routine now. I try to run 3 days and cycle 2 days a week. I do running or cycling events every year to make sure not to slip off from the habit.

**Food**: If there's one thing that helped me lose weight, it's diet. During the first six months of losing weight, I cut down on carbs, sugar, and coffee, started with a vegetable smoothie for breakfast. Today I drink coffee without sugar (and I love it), a smoothie for breakfast, and have carbs in moderation. I do treat myself with ice cream and sweets in moderation. I keep a check on weight and overall fitness.

**Lifestyle**: When you start losing weight, it becomes a family thing. My wife, who was equally invested in the success, lost around 15 kilos. My 6-year-old son competes on daily steps with me. We try to include hikes or parks every weekend and prefer time outdoors than inside a shopping mall or just at home.

Looking back after 4 years, it all started with one run a week. But it has changed a lot in my life.
