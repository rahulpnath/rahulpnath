Tools are indispensable.

For me, since the majority of my work is on a computer, these are software applications. We all have our own likes and dislikes for the tools, for a good reason. _Each of us is different._

_Good tools improve the way to work and think._

Here is a list of tools that drives my personal life (at work, there are different ones).

-   **Notion:** The majority of my time these days is spent in Notion. All of my writing (blogs, essays, notes, goals, video scripting), in fact, anything to do with writing except my to-do list and reminders) is in Notion. I love the simplicity and flexibility it provides. You should give it a try if you haven't - It's FREE for personal use.
-   **Diigo**: I use Diigo to highlight and capture content when reading online. It makes research and taking notes from online reading seamless. It syncs across different machines, including mobile phones.
-   **Todoist:** This has been my task management tool for over 6 years. It's minimalist, clean, and powerful. All my reminders, tasks go into it. It syncs well with all calendars.
-   **Grammarly:** As the name suggests, it scans all my writing for common mistakes in writing. It's an Artificially Intelligent proofreader.
-   **Freedom**: Freedom is a Distraction Blocker software, and I have been using it for the past couple of months. I have 'sacred time blocks,' during which all distracting websites (you define your list) are blocked. It helps you focus on what matters.

Find and master your tools; it'll pay off for a long time.
