URGENT HELP REQUIRED!

I get one of these emails at least once a week, if not more. The default response that comes to mind is to _call 911_. I don't reply that for not wanting to come out rude.

> _No question is a silly question. But ask it well if you want an answer._

_**Respect the other person's time and energy**_ when asking a question.

**Do your research** before reaching out. Not all questions are to be asked to a human. Ask Google. Someone else may have come across a similar problem. But if you do decide to ask,

**Have a** **good title** that summarizes the problem. _Hi; Hello_; Heeeeeelp; _I am stuck. Please help me_ does not count as good titles. Write the question as you would to your busy colleague.

**Provide relevant information** along with the question. Mention the different things you tried. If you don't have any, do your research.

**Don't drip information** across multiple messages. Please don't say Hello and wait for a response. Give all the information at once.

**Format the question well.** Your brain dump is not easy to read. Separate into paragraphs, use sections and headings where necessary. If you are sending code, make sure it is formatted well and readable.

**Re-read before sending**. Use automated proofreading tools like Grammarly. You don't need to be good in the language, but you can put in an effort.

**Ask on a Public Forum** if possible. Send the link to the people you think might help.

Help others, help you.
