All sessions are recorded and are [available here](https://vimeo.com/ndcconferences). The Sydney 2017 ones will soon be there. Overall it was a good event but did not match the one last year. Last year there were more of the popular speakers and the talk content was also more interesting. But still, I am glad that NDC Sydney is still happening, and it gives a good exposure and networking possibilities for developers. Thanks to Readify for sponsoring my tickets and itâ€™s one of the [good things about working with Readify](/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/).

Hope to see you next year as well!
