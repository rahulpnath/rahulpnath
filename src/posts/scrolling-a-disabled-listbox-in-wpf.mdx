Recently I had a requirement when developing an application,where i needed a listbox which was to be disabled but yet can be scrolled,so that all the contents in it was visible.Applying the property,IsEnabled=False makes the whole listbox disabled even disabling the scroll. I just found out a way around this.I created a custom listbox(MyScrollableListbox) with a property IsItemsEnabled.Setting this property to true,gives the normal listbox behaviour.When set to false only the ItemsPresenter of the listbox is disabled,so that scrolling is possible

The Custom Listbox looks like this(just one property added for now)

    Public Class MyScrollableListbox
        Inherits ListBox
    Public Property IsItemsEnabled() As Boolean
     Get
     Return GetValue(IsItemsEnabledProperty)
     End Get
    
    Set(ByVal value As Boolean)
     SetValue(IsItemsEnabledProperty, value)
     End Set
     End Property
    
    Public Shared ReadOnly IsItemsEnabledProperty As DependencyProperty = _
     DependencyProperty.Register("IsItemsEnabled", _
     GetType(Boolean), GetType(MyScrollableListbox), _
     New FrameworkPropertyMetadata(Nothing))
    
    End Class
    

In the xaml(or if you are going to make it a custom control then you can give it in your Generic.xaml)

Now if you set the property IsItemsEnabled to false the listbox will be disabled,but allowing you to scroll.
