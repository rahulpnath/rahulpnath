Learning is Endless.

No matter where you are, what you do, how old you are, you always have to learn one thing or the other. There is no escaping it. Even if you do, you'll 'learn' the hard way.

I often get asked -  _What programming language or technology should I learn next? What am I missing out on? Does learning 'X' have a good future?_

> **_Learning for the sake of learning is not helpful_**

Instead, ask yourself, what do I want to do? What am I learning for? Is it to find a new job? Build an application?

Have a clear goal on what you want to achieve. If you have many things in mind, write them down on paper. Make a list, prioritize. Pick the most important one. This takes time. _Take a break. Think._

**The 3 Step Decision Process**

**1.** What is the next immediate step for the thing you want to do? Is it something you already know? If yes, do it.

**2.** If not, is it something you need to learn? How easily can you learn it, and is it worth spending that time?  If not, delegate it; hire someone to do it for you. Start again from Step 1.

**3.** If you are still here, You now know what you must learn.

Get back to Learning.
