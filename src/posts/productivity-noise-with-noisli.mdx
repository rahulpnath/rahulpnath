If you are the kind of person that likes to listen to some music while working, then this one is for you. Music is proven to have significant effects on improving focus while working. But it is also quite possible to get fully immersed in the music and forget all about work. Different kinds of music contribute to improving concentration while not getting immersed in the music itself. I usually [wear my headphones](http://theheadphonesrule.com/) at work while working and listen to music.

> _Music helps to minimize distractions and helps you reach a state of [Flow](http://amzn.to/2jlYIgV), which is ideal for improving productivity._

At times I like to hear to just some background noises simulating different environments. [Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) is an application that helps mix different sounds and create your perfect environment. The sounds could either be working in a restaurant or while it's raining with thunder, in a forest, by the side of the fire, etc. It helps create the mood that you want and helps recreate it with sound. Since the noises are of a fixed pattern, you soon get used to it and improves concentration at work."
