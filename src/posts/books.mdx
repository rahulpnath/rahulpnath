Over the past couple of years, I have read a lot of [Self-help books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-help_book). Here are a few that I liked and have drawn ideas from. Self-help books in itself is an easy way to procrastinate as you get an immediate high on knowing how optimized and productive your life can be. I have fallen for this a lot of times and its hard to keep away from it. Every time I read one of these books, I get the feeling that this is going to change my life. But then when I get to the end of the book all I need is more of it and ends up [starting with a new book](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/why-self-help-books-rarel_b_9517224.html). Slowly with time I started to realize that all that is happening is reading and very little action.

To be successful with any of these books you need to draw ideas into your daily life and practice them. You need to build short term goals and get the behavior you are trying to create into you.

> _Reading without action is just another way to procrastinate and is a waste of time._

Take notes from the books, see how it can be incorporated into your daily life and improve one at a time. Revisit the notes often. I prefer reading this genre of books on the Kindle ([technical books I prefer physical copy](/blog/ebook-or-hard-copy/)), as it requires little flipping back and forth. On Kindle, you can [add or remove bookmarks, highlights, and notes at any location](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201241990) and revisit this at a later point in time.
