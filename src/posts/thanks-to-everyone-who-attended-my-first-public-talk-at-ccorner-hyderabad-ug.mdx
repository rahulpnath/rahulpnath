Thanks to everyone who attended [my very first public talk](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Events/64/), at the [C#Corner](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/) [Hyderabad Chapter User Group(UG)](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Chapters/6/hyderabad-chapter.aspx) on February 1, Saturday on Windows Phone Development. Summary of the event is available [here](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/subhendude/C-Sharp-corner-hyderabad-user-group-meet-1-february-2014-offici/). It was a very good experience speaking for the first time in front of a large audience, and from my side felt it went well. Here's some follow up information on the talk and also the code samples and presentations used.

-   There might be a lot of you who would be planning to get started with phone development or yet in the dilema of whether or not to - **_'Don't think much and just start [getting your hands dirty](http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us)_**'.
-   If your current project/work does not demand you to use whatever we have got started with it, develop a simple application on your free time/weekends. You would get lot of app ideas at [DVLUP](http://www.dvlup.com/SignIn) and may even get rewarded if you crack some of their challenges - _**Stay motivated.**_
-   Make sure whatever you develop is always properly backed up and stored - _**Use a source control**_. [Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-online-overview-vs#SKUDetailList_1) or [Github](https://github.com/) are great free services that could get you started with.
-   Learn more about [MVVM](/blog/tag/mvvm/).The mvvm toolkit that we were using at the demo is [MVVM Light](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/). There are a couple of videos in [there](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/) that will help you get started with it. [Prism](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/) is also another alternative that we had talked about. - _**Reuse across platforms**_
-   As we had discussed, Getting Started in Windows Phone Development means you have acquired the same skills to Get Started on Windows 8 application too - _**Get started [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/apps/br211386.aspx)**_.
-   There are a lot of applications that are waiting to be developed for Windows phone and Windows 8 for which people are even ready to pay you. So if you want to earn out of your side projects, then try looking for projects in freelancing communities - [ODesk](https://www.odesk.com/), [Freelancer](http://www.freelancer.in/), [Elance](https://www.elance.com/) are some to get you started - **_Earn while you Learn_**

Feel free to get in touch in case you need any help while on your Windows phone journey.
