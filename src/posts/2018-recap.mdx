[Another year](/blog/2017-recap/) has gone by so fast, and it is again time to do a year review.

> **TLDR;**  
2018 saw most of my time in running, cycling and learning to swim. Regular exercise and healthy eating helped [maintain my weight](/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/). Lots of travel added to the excitement. Blogging, Reading, Photography and Open source took the back seat and did not go as planned. Looking forward to 2019!

## What went well

### **Running, Cycling and Learning to Swim**

As planned last year I did two half marathon events - [Brisbane Great South Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/1495400703) and [Springfield Half Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/1628202657). I could also do a [Sub 50 10k](https://www.strava.com/activities/1756881573/overview) run after many tries. Even though running a marathon was part of one of the goals it did not happen. Cycling was on and off, and towards the year end, I started commuting to work (around 10k one way). However, it lasted only around 2 months as I changed client, for which I had to commute to Gold Coast (around 70km, once a week). With swimming, I still struggle to do more than two laps at a stretch. The goal was to swim 1km by the end of 2018 but looks like that's a long way to go. I was often lazy and not motivated to go out to the pool to practice.

I can spend all this time on these activities because of the full support from my wife [Parvathy](https://www.facebook.com/parvathy.panicker).

### **Travel**

We covered a couple of major tourist destinations around Australia - Great Barrier Reef (Cairns), [Gold Coast](/blog/ndc-security-2018-overview-and-key-takeaways/), Frazer Island and Tasmania being the top highlights. We also did a lot of hikes and short trips around Brisbane including Tin Can Bay and Ballina. Snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, Penguin Tour in Tasmania, Whale watching, beach highway drive, and 7 seater beach flight in Frazer Island, dolphin feeding at Tin Can Bay, Croc attack show at Hartley's Crocodile Park were some of the new experiences in life and enjoyed it a lot.

### **Community**

I did two public talks, one at the [.Net User Group](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Brisbane-Net-User-Group/events/251639570/) on Azure Key Vault and one at Readify Back2Base on [Ok I Have Got HTTPS! What Next?](/blog/ok-i-have-got-https-what-next/). Two is still a smaller number and is something I want to do more of in the coming years.

I created a youtube pip video on [Key Vault Connected Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7EPrlpPqXw), and wanted to do couple more of such videos but did not get prioritized enough over the other things. The significant open source contribution was to [KeyVault configuration builder](https://github.com/aspnet/MicrosoftConfigurationBuilders/commits?author=rahulpnath) that is part of the ASP.Net framework.

## What didn't go well

-   **Blogging** Blogging took a back seat this year, even though I had set out to do 4 posts a month. I did a total of 29 posts that's roughly over 2 posts a month. Some months I missed out on it completely.

-   **Reading** [20 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/13036464) was the goal for this year however ended up reading only 6 books. [80/20 Running](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821042-80-20-running) helped me a lot with my running.
-   **Open Source** I wanted to involve with one Open Source project actively, but the only thing that happened was some minor contributions.
-   **Learning** Most of the learning was at work, and I did not actively take up learning anything new. I did start with Category Theory and FSharp again, but it did not stick for a long time.

## Goals for 2019

-   **Reading** Read 10 books
-   **Blogging** 2 posts a month and stay consistent all months
-   **Tri Sports** Complete a Marathon, couple of half marathon event, at least one cycling event and 500m swim.
-   **Learning** Become more proficient with JavaScript. Build [Azure Key Vault Explorer](https://github.com/rahulpnath/keyvaultexplorer) while learning.

I have been on and off my [planning](/blog/experimenting-with-pomodoro-technique/) and [routines](/blog/morning-routine/). Looking to get back with this and organize my day-to-day activities a bit more and be more accountable for the goals that I have set.

Wishing you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year!
