[A year](/blog/2016-recap/) has gone by so fast, and it is again time to do a year review.

> **TLDR;**

> 2017 was the transformation year. Regular exercise and healthy eating helped [loose around 20 kilos](/blog/how-i-lost-13-kilos-in-one-and-half-months/). Lots of travel and blogging made it an excellent year. Reading, Photography and Open source did not go that great. Looking forward to 2018!

## What went well

### **Blogging**

It has been both good and a bad year as far as this blog. Including the '[Tip of the Week](/blog/tag/tipow/)' series I wrote seventy-six posts this year with an average of over six posts per month. This is the good part, as it is well past the goal of a _minimum four posts a month_ goal set last year. But looking at the actual posts per month graph below, it is clear that I have fallen short of it on an actual month by month basis. Up until August, I had a steady stream of posts coming in, from when it started dropping down, with even months (November) with no posts. Mainly it's my laziness to blame, but I can also tell reasons like Vietnam trip, Shifting to Brisbane, etc.

### **Running**

I had started running towards the end of December 2016. One of my goals for 2017 was running, and it has had a good improvement. Ran over 750 kilometers including a half marathon. I am yet to participate in any running events and am planning to in the coming year. I have also started cycling, and it is an excellent way to cross train.

### **Travel**

Did our first international holiday to Vietnam for ten days and was a great experience. Also went around Australia visiting Blue Mountains, Canberra, Port Macquarie, Brisbane and lots of [one-day trips around Sydney](/blog/one-day-trips-around-sydney/). Mandarin Picking, Strawberry picking and Whale watching were some of the top activities for the year.

## What didn't go well

-   **Reading** Had set out with a [goal of 21 books](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/5493-2017-reading-challenge) but ended up finishing only ten books. Of the books I read liked [Mindset](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322) and [How to Win Friends and Influence People,](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439167346/) was the best.
-   **Photography**One trip every three months and post photos were one another goal. The travel part went good (see above), but my DSLR always remained in the bag. Except for a few pictures on the phone camera, there was not much photography done.
-   **FSharp**FSharp was again on and off this year. Apart from a [small utility that I created for Todoist](/blog/todoist-template-transformer-transform-tasks-to-x-days-from-now/), I did not do much F# work.

## Goals for 2018

-   **Blogging** Stick to 4 posts a month. Need to get back on schedule.
-   **Running** Attend few running events. Run a marathon.
-   **Swimming** Having started cycling along with running, has got me thinking about a triathlon. The only thing between is swimming, and I have no clue how to swim. Learning to swim is one of the key goals for the upcoming year. Target is to be able to swim one km.
-   **Open Source** Start working on a side project. Need to find a matching project first.
-   **Reading** Read 15 books

Wishing you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year!
