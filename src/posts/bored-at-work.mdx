Work can sometimes get boring, monotonous, and mundane.

Not always do we get to work on the latest and greatest, or the cutting edge technologies. Often work will not be as interesting as we hear about in conferences, podcasts, or Twitter. Changing jobs might be an option, but at some point will have the same feeling again.

> _Work can be boring, but it does not have to stay that way_

If you look at work with a boring paring of glasses, it is going to be boring. Change your mindset and look at it as something you can get value from (other than money).

I am all about building a personal brand and not letting the work define you. For me, the question I ask every day I go to work is, '_How can I make a blog post out of what I am doing today?_' Back in 2015, I reached John Sonmez, a popular tech blogger on generating blog topics. Even though I never heard back from him, I realized the best way is to look at my own day-to-day work. Most of my blog articles are things I have done at work, shared by pulling it out of its original context to avoid any legal or confidentiality issues. Building out my online presence has been the best thing that has happened for me.

What is the one thing you are going to look forward to from your work?
