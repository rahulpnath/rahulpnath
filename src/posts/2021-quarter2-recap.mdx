This year I started [setting Quarterly Goals](/posts/2020-recap/), and the plan was to track every quarter to keep a check on the progress. And now we are at end of Q2!

Here's a short recap of the last 3 months.

Review of Q2, 2021
------------------

If you're wondering what my Goals were for this period check out my [Quarter 2 post here](/posts/2021-quarter1-recap/).  On a high level, my focus was on 4 Areas of my Life.

Each of these Areas, had associated SMART Goals set, which was mostly measurable. This enabled me to come up with a percentage progress. Even though some of these items where either a done or not done case I ended up coming up with some figures to account for my progress.

_Here's a high level percentage progress for each of the Areas._.

Let's take a closer look at each of the Areas and see how I progressed with it.

### Improve Family Experience ████▓░░░░ 52%

We were almost close to getting a home, but missed it by a few thousands. Brisbane property market is getting hotter each day and it's getting more and more as a first home buyer.

Otherwise things went as planned in this Area - Did more than 3 day trips to local parks and beaches and also did an overnight trip to Toowoomba, Brisbane.I averaged around 80-90 mins for screen time, which is slightly more than what I originally intended it to be.

### Learning █████████░ 90%

Main focus was to learn AWS and improve my overall content generation skills. Both these went exceptionally well. I now have a basic understanding about the AWS concepts, especially around Serverless aspects, that I use at work. As part of my learning I published [5 blog posts](/blog/tag/aws/) and 5 videos to my new .[NET on AWS Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL59L9XrzUa-kl89ThijziX03fgTrbZCd7).

I did the Ship30For30 May Cohort, which involved publishing 30 essays for 30 days. You can check out all my [Atomic Essays here](https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/1392429033837584387). This was a great learning experience for me and I plan to write more Atomic Essays in the coming months. At some point I would love to write a short e-book.

### Improve My Fitness ███████░░░ 70%

Like last time I did not meet my goal I set for myself. But at least there has been some improvement with my overall fitness. I was able to do a few long runs over 10km and slowly getting back into shape. I completed half of the 'Back To Fitness' Zwift Training plan. However I did not meet my time and distance goals.

### Grow Audience ██████████▄ 95%

Focus was to grow 2k YouTube subscribers and gain 100 followers in Twitter.

Below is a snapshot of my Content Calendar for the last quarter. I published **8 blog posts, 10 YouTube videos and [30 Atomic Essays](https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/1392429033837584387).**

![Content Calendar for Q1, 2021](/images/q2_2021_content_calendar_review.jpg)

With the YouTube videos, I missed out on 3 weeks, mostly because a lot was going on with the Ship30For30 Course.

Goals for Q3, 2021
------------------

My high-level Areas of focus remains the same - **Fitness, Grow my Audience, Learning and Improving Family Experience.**

I am looking to improve my Notion setup and the way I track various tasks and activities. Having a good streamlined system is essential to maintain the flow of things.

I am aiming high here with these Goals and would be happy to hit 80% of them. I will do a follow-up review towards the end of September 2021 and see where I stand with these Objectives and Goals.

How's the year been going for you?
