Commuting on a cycle to work is one thing that I look forward to every day. The initial inertia to get started is very high - but trust me, do it once, and you are very likely to continue doing it. I try to commute to work on my [Giant TCR](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/tcr-advanced-pro-1-2016), three days a week. The other two days I go for an early morning run, so I take the bus to work. I use an [Osprey Radial 34](https://www.osprey.com/au/en/product/radial-34-RADIAL34.html) as my commute bag. The bag in itself is excellent and fits comfortably everything I need for the day. It also provides exceptional riding comfort with the padded mesh back. I would recommend the 34L version if you cannot leave things at work (like a pair of Jeans etc.)

Below are the things that are typically there in my bag

1.  [Bike - Giant TCR Advanced Pro 1 2016](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/tcr-advanced-pro-1-2016)
2.  [Lezyne Macro 1100/ Strip PRO 300 Light Set - Black](https://www.amazon.com/LEZYNE-Macro-Drive-1100XL-Strip/dp/B071W3V15M/)

*   [Topeak Aero Wedge QuickClip Saddle Bag](https://www.topeak.com/global/de/products/saddle-bags/129-aero-wedge-pack) Medium Size
*   [Kryptonite Keeper 785 Integrated Chain](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/en/products/product-information/current-key/000853.html)

At work (depending on the client I am with), I usually have access to a bike park area and also showers. I use the [Kryptonite Keeper 785 Integrated Chain](https://www.kryptonitelock.com/en/products/product-information/current-key/000853.html) to secure it to the racks. On weekends, when I go for longer rides, I use the [Topeak Aero Wedge QuickClip Saddle Bag](https://www.topeak.com/global/de/products/saddle-bags/129-aero-wedge-pack) to carry the mini tool, puncture kit, extra tubes, and keys, etc. Since that is a quick release, it is easy to remove/put on as required.

If you are planning to start commuting to work on your bike, don't let the list of things put you off from starting. I started with just the bike and added in all these things one by one over the last year. Do you commute to work on your bike? What gear do you use and find helpful? If you do not try to do at least once a week and soon you will enjoy it like me!
