Over the last week, I have been reading the book [Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport](https://amzn.to/2DSDUto). The central idea of the book is about being aware of the various technologies affecting our lives and making a conscious effort to choose those are required and adds value to your life.

State of My Online Life
-----------------------

Before starting with the book, I have to admit that my online life was not that ordered and thought through. However I was aware of the social media application's taking a significant part of my time, casually browsing without giving any value in return. I had intentionally stopped using Facebook for a couple of months, and now I am completely off it. Instagram was soon to follow except for some occasional posting. I had uninstalled both apps from my phone as it was the main access points to these sites. I had intentionally [turned off all notifications on the phone](__GHOST_URL__/blog/staying-organized-finding-a-system-to-manage-it-all/) for a long time and found it really helpful.

However, what I was not aware of was with these two applications gone I soon started relying on other apps to fill in its place. I am into [running](__GHOST_URL__/blog/three-months-to-a-half-marathon/) and found myself spending more time on Strava. For the social part, I started being more into WhatsApp, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter. When nothing was there, I was hanging on to the email applications pulling to see if anything interesting came in (as if I was expecting a million dollars email). Only after starting with the book did I start realizing that these apps had taken over the ones that I had given up.

Digital Declutter
-----------------

The title of the book, 'Digital Minimalism', immediately caught my attention when I first saw it and I was keen to read it. Primarily I wanted to reduce my phone usage as most of my time was going away there.   Going through the digital declutter phase, I took note of all the technologies and application that are on my phone. The [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208982) feature on iPhone (you can use [Digital Wellbeing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_AU) if you are on an Android or install [RescueTime](__GHOST_URL__/blog/rescue-time-track-your-time/) application) started making me more aware of the time that I have been spending on phone and the apps that took most of my time.

I realized that a majority of my time was spent on WhatsApp especially on Group Chats and scrolling through all the forwarded messages/videos in them and always checking back for more content. Even though I have a Kindle, I was reading more on the Kindle app on phone. Most of the time when reading I would be distracted by something else and wander off to a different app. Even though I had notification turned off new features like [Badges](https://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/97932) took its place which started pulling me again into the apps.

After noting done all the apps and analyzing them, I started decluttering my phone.

*   Exited all Whatsapp Group Chats
*   Removed the below apps
*   Emails (Gmail and Outlook)
*   Slack
*   Strava
*   Yammer
*   LinkedIn
*   Kindle
*   Disabled Badges notification
*   Disabled (Raise to Wake)\[https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208081\]: This is one of the features that lure you to look into the phone even if you did not intend to do.
*   Microsoft Teams: _Initially I had removed Teams, but realized that was the only way to communicate with my Readify team members quickly. So decided to install it back._

By deleting the Kindle app, I am looking to force myself not to use the phone for reading books. I am keen to try out the idea of reading physical books and take notes while reading, an idea that struck me while reading the [Bullet Journal blog](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/book-log) (This is also where I came across the book 'Digital Minimalism' the first time.). I was in India recently and took advantage of getting books for a much lower price and gifted myself some self-help books and a few others.

Interestingly I also came across [Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/) at the same time, which aligns with Digital Minimalism as it forces you to sync to paper your ideas, thoughts, and to-dos as opposed to a [digital system](__GHOST_URL__/blog/todoist-manage-your-todo-list/). I have started trying this out alongside and find it helpful — more on it in a different blog post.

Digital Minimalism Is An Ongoing Process
----------------------------------------

Digital Minimalism is not a one-time activity, but something to perform on an ongoing basis and any time you think of adding a new technology into your life. It has just been over a week that I have started decluttering my online life, and I am already finding benefits. I pick up my phone less often and have lesser a mental load to keep track off.

I plan to do the same decluttering process with my laptop once I get into the flow of the process. Decluttering is a great way to bring in more focus in your life and gives you a lot more time than you previously had. How decluttered is your online life?
