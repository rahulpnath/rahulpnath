It was a busy week with [NDC Sydney](http://ndcsydney.com/) and a lot of other user group conferences happening at the same time since all the international speakers were in town.The conference was three days long with 105 speakers, 37 technologies, and 137 talks.

### Networking

Events like this are a great place to network with other people in the industry and was one of the reasons I wanted to attend NDC. I am a regular reader of Mark Seemann's (@ploeh) blog, and his ideas resonate with me a lot. Also, I find his [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/mark-seemann) videos and his book, [Dependency Injection in .NET](http://amzn.to/2aFmtiC) helpful. It was great to meet him in person and enjoyed both of his talks on FSharp.

### Sponsors

Most of the [event sponsors](http://ndcsydney.com/page/partnership/) had they stall at the conference, spreading their brand (with goodies and t-shirts) and also the work they do (a good way to attract talent to the company). There were also raffles for some big prices like Bose headphones, Das keyboards, Drones, Coffee machines, Raspberry Pi, etc. I was lucky enough to win a Raspberry Pi3 from [@ravendb](https://twitter.com/RavenDB).

It's confirmed that [NDC Sydney is coming back next year](https://twitter.com/samnewman/status/761402917798555648). If you are in town during that time, make sure you reserve a seat.  Look out for the early bird tickets, those are cheap, and the conference is worth it. Thanks to Readify for sponsoring my tickets and it's [one of the good things about working with Readify](__GHOST_URL__/blog/finding-a-job-abroad/).

See you at NDC Sydney next year!
