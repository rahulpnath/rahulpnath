If you are looking to get a case for your phone, then check out cases by [Spigen](https://www.spigen.com/). I have been using Spigen cases for over three years, and I totally recommend it.

Spigen cases are made with premium materials and are slim, sleek and simple. Spigen provides various models that match different needs. The cases provide [Military Grade Protection](https://www.spigen.com/pages/military-grade) and protect the phone from most falls.

The first Spigen cases I got was for my [Nexus 5](__GHOST_URL__/blog/review-two-months-and-counting-android-and-nexus-5/). The Neo Hybrid lasted for over three years. With the Spigen cases, the Nexus was well protected. It did fall from my hands many times, and every time the case protected it well enough. A couple of months back the Spigen case broke, and I had been using the phone without a cover since then. Unfortunately, during one of my [morning runs](__GHOST_URL__/blog/three-months-to-a-half-marathon/) the phone fell from my hands while slipping it into the armband. Without the Spigen to protect it, the Nexus screen broke at the corners.

A month back I switched over to Google Pixel as the Nexus was becoming unusable with the broken screen. I got the [Spigen NeoHybrid for Pixel](https://www.spigen.com/collections/pixel/products/google-pixel-case-neo-hybrid?variant=29248762049). The case provides dual layer protection with TCU and PC bumper and comes with fingerprint resistance. The precise cutouts give easy access to all buttons and fingerprint sensor.

If you are looking to a get a case, check out if [Spigen](https://www.spigen.com/) has one for your model!
