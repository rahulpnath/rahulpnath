I ran out of ideas for today's essay.

Usually, I have one almost ready the day before. I send it to Parvathy, my wife, to review and make the necessary changes the following day. But today, I have nothing. I hit the Dip. I Plateaued.

I know this feeling, and it's not uncommon for me. It's happened with all of my habits; blogging, vlogging, running, etc.

> Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “***I write only when inspiration strikes,***” he replied. “***Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.***”

They say, 'Follow your Passion.' Yes, It might help you get started, but it's not going to get you across the finish line. ***Showing up every day will.***

It's Saturday today. It's the weekend.

I woke up at 4. I recorded a video. I ran 13km. I had a meeting with Eric, my Ship30For30 accountability partner. I went out with my wife and son. I published this article. I showed up everywhere.

Decide what you want to do, but once you do, make sure you show up. It's easy to say, 'I don't have time.' The harder choice is to find the time for what matters. Find pockets of time. I typed the draft for this on my short walk back home after my run.

Believe in your plan. Believe in yourself. Show up.
