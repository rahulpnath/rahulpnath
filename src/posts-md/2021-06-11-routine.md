*I love routines.*

If there is one thing that helps me keep going, it's routines. My routines do keep changing, evolve, and adapt as life happens. But I always make sure to find a routine that works around all the other important things in life.

*Our days make up our lives.*

I am a morning person and find it extremely useful to have a routine to wake to. This in itself energizes me to wake up and get things done. A morning routine is nothing but a sequence of actions regularly followed.

I have tried switching to late in the night but found mornings work best for me. It helps me set the pace for the day and get done with my Most Important Things (MITs).

The MITs are aligned with my Quarterly Goals. It gives meaning to the day-to-day tasks and helps stay focused. My current goals are to grow an audience, learning and stay fit.

***My Current Routine***

1. Wake at 4 am
2. Brush, Drink water, Stretch
3. Review Plan for Day (in Notion)
4. MITs â†’ Learning, Vlogging, Blogging
5. Run or Cycle (5 days a week, 2 days rest)

The routine helps ease into the day without having to hurry with anything. I have a short evening routine that sets me up for the next day.

Build your life with routines.
