My first article on MSDN Magazine is published in the September 2015 edition and is available for [reading online](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/mt422585). The article titled, '*Microsoft Azure - Protect Sensitive Information with Azure Key Vault*', discusses on common problems in storing sensitive information in applications, benefits of Azure Key Vault and how we can quickly setup and start using it.

It was a great experience working with the MSDN magazine team, and got to learn a lot of things. Also special thanks to [Amit Bapat](https://twitter.com/amitbapat) and [Sumedh Barde](https://twitter.com/sumedhbarde) for doing the technical review and clarifying certain things for the article.
