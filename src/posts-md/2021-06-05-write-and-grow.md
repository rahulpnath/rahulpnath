*We write to learn.*

We write to plan. We write to make checklists. We write emails. We write text messages. We write all the time. But when putting your name under the writing and publishing it, we delay it as much as possible. We find reasons not to write. We procrastinate; we do everything else except write.

*We are afraid of being wrong.*

Your writing isn't the last word on that topic. Often it isn't to ourselves. Our thoughts change, we grow, we think differently. I don't hold the same opinions or thoughts that I had ten years ago. Not even a year ago.

> *It's ok to be wrong. Let that not stop you from writing.*

But putting your thoughts out in the open, you are opening up a faster feedback loop for your thoughts. People get a chance to interact with that content and share their experiences and thoughts with you. Even if they feel differently, you are getting a faster chance to learn from others.

If you are still unsure, the easiest way I find is to write the 'How To' category of posts. Pick anything that you did at work and write about it. As they say, there are more than a hundred ways to do something, and your's is one more to it.

As you write more, you'll slowly build momentum and confidence to write and explore more. Soon you will be able to let go of that fear holding you back.

Don't be afraid to grow with your writing.
