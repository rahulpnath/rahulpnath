With WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation), we saw the complete designer-developer separation,making it one of the best presentation technologies available at present.
Windows Workflow Foundation(WF) brings about the separation of the 'when-and-what',says Bruce Bukovics,author of [Pro WF: Windows Workflow in .NET 4 (Expert's Voice in .NET)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430227214/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1430227214&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rahulpnath-20).You get to change the when without touching the what.All the business logic are packed into components,activities rather(in WF terms) and the control flow is between the activities is 'declaratively' controlled.Don't be surprised,its XAML again.

Though being newbie on WF,I got to take a session on WF,at my workplace, which made me dive little more deeper into it(so that I don't bluff my way through the 1 hour session :) ).All I could explore was the overview of the features,which seems promising and interesting.
This book I got hold of seems to clear the way ahead and make it easy.

More on WF soon :)
