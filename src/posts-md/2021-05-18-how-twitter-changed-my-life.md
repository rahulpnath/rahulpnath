I landed my first job offer abroad through Twitter.

I still remember sending the direct message to Damian Hickey (@randompunter) like it was yesterday. I was in Trivandrum (Kerala, India) on a late evening in January 2015 while my wife and mom played with my then 3-month-old son.

Two months later, I was with his team for my final interview sitting in their Amsterdam office.

*I went back to India the same day with a job offer.*

I ended up migrating to Australia for various other reasons, where I still am. But the idea of a job abroad started with the direct message that day.

> *The flutter of the little blue bird can do wonders.*

I have been consistently creating videos for my YouTube channel, almost 1 video per week. I usually average around 2-3 subscribers a day.

But one day, I woke up to 200+ new subscribers!  Because Scott Hanselman (@shanselman), a tech influencer, decided to retweet one of my videos.

The experiences don't end there.

Becoming an MSDN Magazine author, a core contributor of an open-source project,  endless queries answered within minutes if not hours all happened on Twitter.

Constraints breed creativity - no wonder why the 280 character limit makes the word-to-value ratio the highest for any social media platform.

Tweet, tweet
