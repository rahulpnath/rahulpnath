*I started running once a week in December 2016.*

Losing weight was my main goal when I started, which I indeed did.  Along with a strict diet and some light running, I lost 13 kilos in 6 weeks. Ever since, I've fallen in love with running and have run over 3000km. Aside from the health benefits of running, it is also a great teacher.

*Running trains your mind.*

> "*Running is nothing more than a series of arguments, between the part of your brain that wants to stop and the part that wants to keep going.*"

Running teaches you to focus, stick with things a lot longer even if you don't like or see immediate results, push yourself to keep going, and fight resistance. No matter how short or long the run, your mind always plays tricks to make you stop.

*Passion is overrated.*

Passion might be what gets you started with anything in life, but soon enough, resistance will set in.  You will go through the phase of the daily grind, where you need to show up and do the work. There is no passion. It's just mere work.

*Success and Mastery lie beyond the daily grind.*

How long it takes you to reach there depends on the race you are into. Don't stop when you are tired; stop when you are done.

One step at a time.🏃‍♂️
