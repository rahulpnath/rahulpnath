My writing sucked. It still does.

The one thing I always tell anyone who asks me for career advice is to start writing online. Nine times out of ten, I get the same answer.

*"I am not good at writing. It's hard even to write a line. How do you do this?"*

If you haven't written a line, how do you tell you can't write? Thatâ€™s the problem you havenâ€™t shipped to tell whether it sucks or not. You think it sucks. Maybe it does, but it doesnâ€™t matter.

We evaluate content based on the standards of the content we consume. We compare ourselves with established writers and rate our content against theirs.

But if you look at their first article, that would have sucked too. What matters is not whether itâ€™s good or bad. What matters is that you ship. Only then will you know Whatâ€™s Working, Whatâ€™s Not, Whatâ€™s Good, and Whatâ€™s Bad.

I improved a lot since I first started writing. Yes, go check out my very first article from 2009 on my blog. Now you know what Iâ€™m saying.

Yes, my writing sucked, it sucks, and it always will.

***What matters is itâ€™s improving.***

That perfect post lives in our minds. The only way to get it out is to write.

Write and Ship ðŸš¢
