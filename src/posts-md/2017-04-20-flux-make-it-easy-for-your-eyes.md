excerpt: Make the color of your computer display adapt to the time of day.

If you spent a lot of time in front of a computer then [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) is for you. You would have heard that using laptop or mobile just before sleep is bad. It is because of the [blue light](http://www.bluelightexposed.com/) that digital screens emit.

> *During the day, computer screens look goodâ€”they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.*

> *f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.*

*Tell f.lux what kind of lighting you have, and where you live. Then forget about it. f.lux will do the rest, automatically.*
f.lux adjusts the screen to the room you are in and the time of the day. You can set the lighting that the room has, and it will adjust the screen for it.

I have been using f.lux for a couple of years and had it always on(except occasionally when [processing photos](__GHOST_URL__/blog/photography-learning-to-click/)). [f.luxometer](https://fluxometer.com/) tells how much blue light f.lux removes if you are interested.
