As I was migrating my blogs on to wordpress,I just went through all my previous posts.It seems all my posts are just a brief overview ,very brief indeed,on various topics and promising detailed posts in due time.But nothing detailed ever turned up.I guess I have to stick on to the promises and start writing blogs in detail,explore things in detail.

Not this post but...aaaahh....procrastination!!!!!

No definitely not Â (atleast to keep myself happy ;)).

But definitely the next post.

Ps: And it feels better to use wordpress :)
