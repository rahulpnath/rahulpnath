Blogs are always a very good medium to express our thoughts,views,knowledge and much more.In cases of where you blog on topics new to you,blogging can also be a way to learn and to get feedback.

But what good does it come to if the reader base for your blogs are less.It's true that with social sites like Facebook,twitter etc you stand a better chance to publicize your blogs more and increase your reader base.But still it has its own limitations as not all of the people that follows you might be interested in the topics that you blog.So the best thing would be to find communities/group blogs that relate to topics that you commonly blog on and contribute there.

Being in Microsoft I have this privilege of having a space in the msdn blogs.Its been a long time since I had started an account [there](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rahulpnath/) and kept thinking on what to post.I think its high time to start off with that and enjoy one of the biggest reader base for technical topics.

Why from today but???.....Thanks to the guys who motivated me to move on and venture out. :)

**Edit:** Yes I still do have the privilege, but I think it is better to have it here in my on domain than anywhere else, as it will always be mine. So I have decided to keep all my thoughts and posts on this site. I have even moved from wordpress hosting to a self hosted one so I have more control.
