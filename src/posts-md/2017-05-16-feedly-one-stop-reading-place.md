Do you want a one stop reading place to stay current and updated with posts from various blogs of your interest?

> *Feedly is a news aggregator application that compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources*

[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is what you are looking for. You can subscribe to the sites and news sources that you want to follow and Feedly shows that as a combined list for you.

News sources can be grouped into custom collections to group similar categories of information. Feedly offers a clean and minimalist reading experience, removing all the ads and other elements that create clutter. You can save articles to be read later, mark as favorite, share articles and a lot more.

Feedly has [apps and browser plugins](https://feedly.com/apps.html) for a broad range of platforms and provides a uniform experience across devices. Currently, I am on the free version of the application, and it has a limit of 100 feeds. The [pro version](https://feedly.com/i/pro/) provides a lot more features if you are interested.

Get a one stop reading place, Get [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)!
