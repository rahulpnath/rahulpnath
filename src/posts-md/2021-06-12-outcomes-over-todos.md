*I plan my week on a Sunday evening.*

It takes 30-40 minutes for this. I have a page for each week in Notion, where I keep track of my plan. I review the week that's gone by to find what worked what didn't and take that into planning the upcoming week.

> *Getting it out of your head is how you get things done.*

*I plan for Outcomes.*

Outcomes are like mini-goals which usually consist of more than one task. E.g., Publish this essay is an outcome. Draft, Edit, Format, and Publish are tasks that help achieve this outcome.

*I follow the **Rule of 3.***

What are the 3 outcomes I want to achieve?  I ask this when doing yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily planning. Find and align outcomes at each level that helps you reach the goal at the immediate next level.

One of my goals for this quarter is to grow my audience, so every week, I have an outcome of publishing one video to my YouTube channel.

If you are feeling adventurous, you can set a **MUST**, **SHOULD,** and **COULD** list. So if you run out of items in one list, you can pick from the next.

Having a system to work within is great. It allows you to focus on the things that matter at any time. I don't have to think about what to do next. I use a combination of Notion and Todoist app for planning.

Goals without plans are wishes.
