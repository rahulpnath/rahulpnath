*I don't have anything to write.*

This is a common excuse I hear when the topic of starting a blog or writing online comes up. I think everyone should be writing online, sharing their journey and their experiences. I tell this to anyone who asks me for some career advice.

*You don't have to invent on your own to write online.*

Our journey is unique, and so is the perspective that we bring to work. So the experiences are unique in their own ways and something we must share.

> "*Obvious to you. Amazing to others.*" - Derek Sivers

I share the things I learn or problems I come across at work on my blog and YouTube channel. None of these are mind-blowing; it's very similar to what any other programmer would be encountering at work.

I write and share to help someone coming along and for myself if I need to do something similar. I have had many people thank me for some of the posts written months or years ago.

What's my rule of thumb to write an article? If I had to look up multiple online sources, then I write about it. It's very likely to help someone else from looking up those different sources.

Write and Share, even if it's obvious to you.
