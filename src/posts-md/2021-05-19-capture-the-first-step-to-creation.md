How do I make this into a blog post?

Every time I do something at work, this is one question on top of my mind. Â How can I share this with the next person coming along, to my team, to anyone who might need to do the same thing elsewhere? Most importantly, how can I help my future self to do this same thing?

When I started blogging, I struggled to come up with topics to write about. I spent most of my time thinking about what to write.

> *The battle is half lost if you start with a blank page.*

Any time you come across something interesting, learn something new, hear something that sparks an idea, make sure to capture it. *Don't defer; you will forget. Capture it immediately.*

Have a central place to capture, where your ideas, thoughts, and experiences can live outside of your brain, a place where you can freely play around and interconnect the dots, a place where you create - ***Your Second Brain***.

This place could be anything - a notebook, a file, a pile of cards, an app - anything that works for you. For me, this is Notion.

Anytime you need to write, look into your Second Brain. Your storehouse of ideas, notes, and thoughts from where you can easily get inspired and Create.

Start Capturing Today.

Start Fresh, Not Blank.
