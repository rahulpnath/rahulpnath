Quite a few of you might be thinking on what this "Stars" are :).It's nothing other than the " little medals under ones [Display Name](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=Rahul%20P%20Nath&amp;referrer=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.msdn.microsoft.com%2fforums%2fen-US%2fwpf%2fthreads%2f&amp;rh=6B76a24eG8mIv3Gbc46komILEicsF8SS2q2mVnak%2bVQ%3d&amp;sp=forums) ".Think I have put you again in thought.Not for too long but,it is the MSDN forum rating that I am talking about.
I started answering posts as a pastime.Soon I noticed this little stars ,varying in count, under different display names.A little bit of exploration gave me [this ](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/help#310)piece of information.
The 'Pastime' turned an 'Addiction'.

"Do they pay you??"
"Are you rewarded??"
"They might give you something!!""

The common statements that I heard, whenever people see me browse the forum.
None of these were the reason for my addiction though.It was just the personal satisfaction I get from answering the questions, a new learning and a different perspective for some of the problems I had already faced.
