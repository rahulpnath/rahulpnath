_As a kid, I loved pocket money._

There were some general guidelines on what are the things I could buy what I shouldn't. But other than that I could choose to buy things that I like. Save up for larger things or go out and have fun with my friends.

_I could buy whatever I wanted. No questions asked._

For a long time since marriage, we both 'asked each other' before making any purchase. No matter the size of the purchase, we asked. We sometimes get questioned by the other and, worst of all, be judged.

Where are all the perks of being an adult that you once wished for as a kid?

**Welcome to our Splurge System**

Every month, we send A$200 to our 'Splurge Debit cards'. We get to spend this money on whatever we want. No questions asked, no judgments made. It's ours to spend.

The allowance is for anything that isn't for daily family expenses. If I decide to have a coffee outside with my friend, it goes under splurge. Same if my wife wants to buy some clothes. I could eat outside or save up to buy a watch or a new monitor. It's all up to the individual.

This system stopped impulse buying, no resentments, and best of all, no more 'asking for permission.' Is there money in the splurge? You get to buy it.

Splurge on yourself. It's self-care.
