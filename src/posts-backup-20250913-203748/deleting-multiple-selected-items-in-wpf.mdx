Hi, Many a times while using listbox,listview etc there might be a need to delete the multiple selected items. This can be easily achieved by the following piece of code

```csharp
 While ControlName.SelectedItems.Count &gt; 0Â 
   ControlName.Items.Remove(ControlName.SelectedItem)
End While

```

Happy Coding :)
