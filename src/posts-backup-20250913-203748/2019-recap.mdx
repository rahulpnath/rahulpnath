> **TLDR;**

> 2019 has been a fantastic year with lots of new learning, blogging, reading, running, and cycling. I started creating content for YouTube. Travel and Swimming did not go as planned. Looking forward to 2020!

## What went well

### **Running and Cycling**

I did lots of running and cycling again this year. I wanted to do a couple of events (including a full marathon); however, that did not happen. The only event I did was the <BlogLink

/>, which was my first 100k cycling and a great experience. I got a Tacx Neo towards the end of the year and looking to start using it for structured training in the coming years. For running following the [FIRST Running Plan](https://www.marathon-training-program.com/three-day-program-finish/) has helped me a lot to improve on my average pace.

### **Blogging and YouTube**

I was a lot more consistent with the number of posts this year. Except for October (while I was on vacation), I had a minimum of 2 posts every month. I am also trying to complement the blog posts with [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/rahulnathp) and be more regular at it. I have published 10+ videos since August and trying to build up my channel and content. _[Subscribe here](https://www.youtube.com/user/rahulnathp) if you are interested to know every time a new video is published._

### **Learning and Reading**

I stumbled across [Exercism: A Great Addition To Your Learning Plan](/blog/exercism/) during the year and found the FSharp track interesting. I completed the core exercises on the track. CSS is something I have always struggled. Towards the end of this year, I took the [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course on Udemy. I am halfway through the course and finding it extremely useful. It helped me heaps to get going with CSS and SASS. I did want to build the Key Vault Explorer; however that never took off.

[![](/images/2019_books.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/16611361)

As for reading, I had set the goal of 10 books for this year and happy to have finished [11 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/16611361). I highly recommend the book Digital Minimalism and the Bullet Journal Method. Here is what I have been [Digital Minimalism](/blog/digital-minimalism/) and how I have been using the [Bullet Journaling](/blog/bullet-journaling/).

## What didn't go well

I happy this year with having set out with the right goals and being able to meet most of them. Here are some things that could have been better.

-   **Swimming** It's been almost two years since I have been on and off with swimming. I have come a long way forward, however, not still to the point where I am comfortable to say I know swimming well.
-   **Travel** Two trips back to India took most of my vacation time. We also visited Bundaberg and Rockhampton - places within Brisbane. However, we did not make any other international trips.

## Goals for 2020

-   **Reading** Read 12 books - Bumping up two books from the last year's challenge. I want to add more variety to the books.
-   **Blogging and Youtube** 3 posts and 3 videos every month. Try and build up a niche/specialization. It is something I have wanted to do for a long time but never happened.
-   **Tri Sports** Complete a Marathon. Focus more on swimming. Complete a training program on my Tacx Neo with Trainer Road.
-   **Learning** Learn about Containers and [SAFE stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/).

I started with [Bullet Journaling](/blog/bullet-journaling/) in 2019, and it has been helping me a lot with planning and organizing myself. I plan to use the same in 2020 and have got a new Journal, all ready to go.

Wishing you all a Happy and Prosperous New Year!
