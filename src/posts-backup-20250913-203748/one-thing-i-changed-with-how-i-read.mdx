Take Notes.

Much of my reading is either online on a computer browser or my Kindle. Mostly when I read, I think of a way to share it. It could be a blog post, video, Social Media, etc.

> _Have a clear purpose for your notes; if not, taking them will feel like a burden._

Sometimes when I read, I take notes to improve understanding and help follow through with the content. These are throw-away notes or 'fleeting notes.'

For long-lasting 'permanent notes, I go through these 3 levels of Note Taking.

**Highlight:** As I read, I highlight the content that I find relevant and resonates with me. I add my own notes, if any, along with the highlight. Highlighting by itself is not actively engaging. If all you do is highlighting, you are better off not doing it.

**Engage:** Once I am done with the reading (or research), I look through the highlights and logically arrange them. I rewrite the content _**in my own words.**_ This is actively engaging with the content. Do not copy-paste. You can share this with others as a blog, tweet, video, etc.

**Connect:** Find similar ideas in your note collection and connect them. How you connect vary based on your note-taking system (e.g., a number on a physical card, hyperlink in software systems, etc.). This step requires more time and thinking, and I don't do it always. But this helps build analogy and draw parallels between otherwise unrelated topics.

Highlight, Engage and Connect the next time you read.
