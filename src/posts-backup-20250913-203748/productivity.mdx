"_You eat every day?_"

"_Oh, Yes! I eat 4 times a day._"

"_Wow, that must be really important to you._"

Some days we eat fast, eat at the desk, skip one meal, but we still eat. We find time for important things.

I blog, vlog, learn, run and read because it's important to me.

“_The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities._”,  Stephen Covey.

I watch TV, play video games, hang out with friends, go out with family. It’s great and absolutely required to recharge.

But at times, I do too much of it. I play 10 hours of video games, and I feel bad about it. Then it’s about asking myself, “Do I really need 10 hours to recharge? Or can I read, learn or blog for 2 hours and play 8 hours”

> _Being productive is about being intentional. Being deliberate about what you are doing._

It's easy to stay busy and not have much done. Busyness is when you have many things to do, and you are not intentional about them.

Over the last 30 days, I wrote about productivity, systems, mindsets, hacks, tools, and ways of working that help me be intentional, stay focused, and keep myself in check.

_Be intentional. Be Productive._
