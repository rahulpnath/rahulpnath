The AWS Serverless Application Template that comes with the AWS Toolkit is poorly structured.

Serverless Applications. The `Functions.cs` file in the template has the whole application in it; interacts with AWS infrastructure, has domain logic, and interacts with DynamoDB. For a template, it is ok; but for your real-world applications, you can do better.

/>, I showed how to get started with building Serverless Application in AWS. If you are new to AWS Serverless, I recommend reading that and coming back to this post.

Ok, now that you have seen how the AWS Serverless Application Template is structured and works end to end, let's see how we can structure the application for easier maintainability.

This is a series of posts that I will be linking here as and when I publish them.
