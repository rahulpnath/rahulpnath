Learning by doing has been proven effective and is the same when learning a new programming language. However, it is also equally important that you learn the right things and in the correct manner. Having a mentor or a goto person in the field that you are leaning is essential. [Exercism](https://exercism.io) brings both together under one place and free of cost.

> _[Exercism](https://exercism.io) is an online platform designed to help improve your coding skills through practice and mentorship._

Exercism is a great site to accompany your journey in learning something new.

-   It has a good set of problems to work your way through the language.
-   A good breakdown of the language concepts covered through the exercises. Exercism gives an overview on what to concentrate next.
-   The best part is the mentor feedback system. Each time you submit a main/core exercise, there is an approval system in place. To me, learning a language is more about understanding the language-specific features and writing more idiomatic code.

Exercism is entirely open source and open to your [contributions](https://github.com/exercism) as well. It takes a lot of effort to maintain something of this standard — also a great effort from the mentors by providing feedback.

> Feedback is useful, especially when moving across programming paradigms - like between OO and Functional.

Solving a problem is just one piece of the puzzle. Writing idiomatic code is equally important, especially when learning a new language. Feedbacks such as the above helps you think in the language (in my case, F#).

Don’t wait for feedback approval, but work on side exercises. Twitter or slack channels are also a great way to request feedback. Reading along with a book helps if you need more structured learning. For F# I have been reading the book [Real World Functional Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Functional-Programming-Tomas-Petricek/dp/1933988924)

I discovered Exercism while learning FSharp. It has definitely helped keep me in the [Staying in the Learning Loop](/blog/staying-in-the-learning-loop/). Hope it helps you!
