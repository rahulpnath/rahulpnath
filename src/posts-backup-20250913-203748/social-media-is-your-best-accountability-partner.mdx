_It's 5:30 am and 8 degrees outside. I am lazy to go out for a run._

The very thought of going into that breezy cold air makes me want to cuddle up at the corner of the sofa, my favorite resting place. That's exactly what I do.

I lie down lazily flicking through the Twitter feed. I come across my own tweet from yesterday.

> _"Looking forward to my 11k run tomorrow._ 🏃‍♂️"

My ambitious self had planned the night before of going for an 11km run this morning. It kicks back in again. Five minutes later, I am out of my front door, putting on my headphones with my running playlist on.

I was successful in tricking my brain into getting out of my laziness. To be accountable to my own words, I have no other way but to run. _I used my ego to the advantage here._

_Social Media is a great accountability partner._ Use it to your advantage. Make small announcements, set goals, talk about your failures, express your fears. Find courage in being vulnerable. That's when you grow.

Be prepared to dump the haters; they are going to be everywhere. Take in the community that is always out there to help you.

Share your journey. Learn from others.

_(And Yes, there are days when my 6-year-old wakes me up on the sofa.)_
