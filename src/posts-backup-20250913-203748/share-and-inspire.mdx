When I started this blog around nine years back, my only intention was to share technical posts. But over period of time I started writing about a variety of things including [productivity tips](/tag/productivity/) that I found useful, [travelogues](/tag/travelogue/), [random thoughts](/tag/thoughts/), <BlogLink

/>, [blogging](/tag/blogging/) etc. One of the things that I have noticed is that a lot of people have been inspired by these various posts and photos that I post online and have triggered them to do similar things.

I've had my own similar inspirations to start the various things that I do today. Like for instance, I started running after being inspired by my friends, [Satish](https://twitter.com/SatyKrish), [Suresh](https://www.facebook.com/jeyakums) and [Thiru](https://www.facebook.com/thirusv). I reached out to them for various tips when I started running a year ago. From running I moved on to cycling and a bit of swimming after seeing my friend [Rahul](https://www.facebook.com/rahul.revikumar477977). For travel, my inspiration has been [Arun Sudheendran](https://www.facebook.com/arun.sudheendran.1) and [Deepak Suresh](https://www.facebook.com/deepak.suresh) who do a fair bit of exploration. I tend to reach out to them for travel ideas and places to visit. Similarly, there have been inspirations from people that I have never met or met just once or twice.

Below is a transcript of a chat with one of my readers whom I have never met. It's a great feeling to wake up to such messages and it boosts your own motivation to continue what you are doing.

Social media plays a great role in spreading information these days. When you see people in your own friend's circle start doing things that you have always wanted to, it gives you an extra push to give it a try. There might be some people who feel you are sharing too much of things that don't interest them. For those, there is always an option to un-follow, mute, filter etc. Don't let that thought stop you from sharing things that you do.

Such a small act of sharing, even things that you might have seen someone do could add up and be of big impact to someone else, often referred to as the [Butterfly Effect](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheButterflyEffectOfTechnologyCommunity.aspx).

> The **Butterfly Effect**: This effect grants the power to cause a hurricane in China to a butterfly flapping its wings in New Mexico. It may take a very long time, but the connection is real. If the butterfly had not flapped its wings at just the right point in space/time, the hurricane would not have happened. - [Chaos Theory](http://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-is-chaos-theory/)

Share things that you do, share positive things and inspire others!
