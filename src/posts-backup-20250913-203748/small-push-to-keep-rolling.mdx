"_I don't want to play this game anymore._"

Gautham's no longer excited about the Super Mario Bowser's Fury game. When asked, he said it's too hard. He was stuck. I managed to help him out after some tries, and he's now back on it.

"_Yay, I love this. I need 10 more cat shines._"

In life, we often get stuck with different things. It could be for various reasons, including not knowing how to do something, finding something hard to understand, running out of energy, feeling lazy, etc.

> "_Until you believe you have options, youâ€™ll continue to feel stuck_"

When you don't know or find something hard, the easiest option is to switch to something else and try after some time. Our brain has this magical power of solving things in the background. If that does not work, reach out to a friend, colleague, or the Internet.

Falling into a slump and not feeling motivated to do things is another way to feel stuck. For me, this often happens with blogging and vlogging. I reach out to my audience for ideas, suggestions, and feedback. It helps to keep going.

Keep yourself open to get these small nudges to boost yourself. I often get video and blog ideas as questions, comments, emails, or tweets. I get coffees through the buymeacoffee website, which gives me the push to create more content.

A small push can take you a long way.
