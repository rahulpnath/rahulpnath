Hi,  
Of late I have developed the habit of reading books,most of them technical and few others which i feel interesting or of controversial topics.Now in the era of computers you get all the books of choice available right at the click of a button.But I prefer the Hard copies rather than the soft one.  
Usually I go through the e-version of the book to get a feel about it,before buying.  
Whether to read the ebook or the hard copy is purely of personal interest.I prefer the latter just coz of the feeling of having a book in hand and reading is great rather than sitting in front of a monitor/pda.Moreover I spent a lot of time in front of the monitor,coz my work demands it ,so i just don't want to add a reason to spend more.

The question is not "which is better",it's just about getting into the habit of reading :)

Happy Reading :)
