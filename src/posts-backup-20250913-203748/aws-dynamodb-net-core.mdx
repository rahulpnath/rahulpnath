DynamoDB is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). DynamoDB provides _reliable performance,_ a _managed experience,_ and a convenient _API access_ to interact with it.

> _Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability._

With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. DynamoDB supports on-demand backups and can also enable point-in-time recovery of the data.

It also supports automatic expiry of items to reduce storage and associated cost.

DynamoDB is a fully managed database, which means you don't need to spin up server instances, software installations, or other maintenance tasks.

In this post, let's learn more about DynamoDB and using it from a .NET application. We will learn how to create tables and do basic Create Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations from the .NET application using the DynamoDB SDK.

To get started, let's create an ASP NET Web API application from the default template. If you are using the [dotnet CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/), you can use `dotnet new webapi` command to create a new Web API application.

It will create an API application with a default _WeatherForecast_ Controller that returns some hardcoded data. It also comes with [Swagger Endpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UlCaK9iJaI) setup.

Let's move this hardcoded data into DynamoDB and starting retrieving it from there.

Let's add an extra property, `City`, to the `WeatherData` class to identify the city of the weather data. We will use this shortly.

## Set Up DynamoDB

To create a Table to hold the Weather Data, head off to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) and navigate to DynamoDB (by searching in the top bar, _Alt+S)_. Make sure you are in the appropriate Region where you want to create the Table.

The core components in DynamoDB are **Tables**, **Items** and **Attributes**.

> _A Table is a collection if Items and each Item is a collection of Attributes._

To create a table, use the 'Create table' button on the DynamoDB page. It prompts you to enter the _Table Name_ and _Primary key_ as shown below.

DynamoDB supports two different kinds of primary keys.

-   **Partition Key →** A simple primary key, with just one attribute. Not two items can have the same partition key value
-   **Partition Key and Sort Key →** A composite primary key composed of two attributes. One attribute is the partition key, and the other a sort key. It's possible for two items to have the same partition key; however, they must have different sort keys. The combination of them must be unique.

To store the `WeatherFOrecast` let's create a new table with the same name (you can use a different name if you want). For the Primary key, since the weather data is retrieved based on the city, we will make that the Partition key. For the Sort key, we can use the Date property.

In this case, we can only have one Item for a city with a particular date time. If we decide to store only the date part, excluding the time, then only one record for a day.

To add items to the Table from the portal, use the _Create Item_ button.

Since we specified City and the Date as the composite primary key, any item added to this table must have those two properties.

![Create Item in DynamoDB table](/images/aws_dynamodb_create_item_portal.jpg)

There can be any other property on the Item and necessarily need not be the same for each item.

We can add JSON data to the table as below → On top of City and Date properties, it contains Summary and Temperature in Celsius as our `WeatherForecast` class.

```json
{
  "City": "Brisbane",
  "Date": "2021-04-02T02:10:40.595Z",
  "Summary": "Warm",
  "TemperatureC": 20
}

```

Below is a snapshot of the Table with a few items added to it.

## Set up App to Use DynamoDB

With the data set up in DynamoDB, let's update the Web API application to retrieve the data from DynamoDB.

To get started, let's first add the [DynamoDB NuGet package.](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.DynamoDBv2/) → `AWSSDK.DynamoDBv2` .

The [IDynamoDBContext](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DotNetDynamoDBContext.html) provides the necessary methods to interact with DynamoDB. Update the `WeatherForecastController` constructor to take in the interface.

If you have used [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework) in the past, this context is very similar to the EF Context. (If you haven't don't worry, I've got you covered).

Usually, we want to get the weather forecast for a city, so let's update the Get method to take in a city name. Based on the city name (which is the hash/partition key), we can retrieve all the items in that partition.

_The Query operation allows selecting multiple items with the same partition/hash key and (if specified) apply filter conditions on the range/sort keys._

The `Get` method below uses the `DynamoDBContext` to perform the `Query` operation and get back all the items with the given `city` name as the partition key.

```csharp
public WeatherForecastController(
    IDynamoDBContext dynamoDbContext,
    ILogger<WeatherForecastController> logger)
{
    _dynamoDbContext = dynamoDbContext;
    _logger = logger;
}

[HttpGet]
public async Task<IEnumerable<WeatherForecast>> Get(string city = "Brisbane")
{
    return await _dynamoDbContext
        .QueryAsync<WeatherForecast>(city)
        .GetRemainingAsync();
}

```

The `Get` function now returns all the weather forecast data for the given city name. But the initial hard-coded data we replaced was returning only the weather forecast for the upcoming 5 days.

We can add a filter condition on the date (range key) to match the original functionality.

```csharp
return await _dynamoDbContext
    .QueryAsync<WeatherForecast>(
        city, 
        QueryOperator.Between, 
        new object[] { DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(1), DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(5)})
    .GetRemainingAsync();

```

The above query uses the `Between` operator on the date range key to filter out the items between a specific date range. Similarly, there are [different operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html#Query.KeyConditionExpressions) like _Equal, LessThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, BeginsWith_, etc.

Based on the operator, the number of parameters passed as the third parameter differs. Since `Between` requires the from and to date, I am passing 2 dates above.

### Dependency Injection

With the Controller now using the `IDynamoDBContext` let's wire up the application to be able to dependency inject an implementation for it.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YR6HkvNBpX4" />

**NOTE:** _To keep things simple, I've hard-coded the Access Key and the Secret Key in the code. You should move this into [Configuration file](https://youtu.be/5GlgHV_12-k) and use [Secret Manager](https://youtu.be/PkLLP2tcd28) for local development._

```csharp
var credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("<ACCESS_KEY>", "<SECRET_KEY>");
var config = new AmazonDynamoDBConfig()
{
    RegionEndpoint = RegionEndpoint.APSoutheast2
};
var client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient(credentials, config);
services.AddSingleton<IAmazonDynamoDB>(client);
services.AddSingleton<IDynamoDBContext, DynamoDBContext>();

```

The above code creates an `AmazonDynamoDBClient` using the credentials and Region to access DynamoDB for your account. The `DynamoDBContext` requires only the `AmazonDynamoDBClient`.

To set up _ACCESS\_KEY_ and _SECRET\_KEY_ navigate to the [Identity And Access Management (IAM)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home) in the  Console and under Users, create a new user. Add the appropriate permissions for DynamoDB.

In the below case, I have given `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` which grants full access to DynamoDB resources.

![Add User in IAM to access DynamoDB](/images/aws_dynamodb_iam_user.jpg)

Run the application, and voila! We have the API now retrieving the data from DynamoDB.

### CRUD Operations

The `IDynamoDBContext` has other methods that help with the basic Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations.

The `SaveAsync` method creates a new Item if the primary key does not already exist. If it exists, it will overwrite the existing item with the new item values.

Below I use the `GenerateDummyData` to generate some weather forecast given a city name. Using the `SaveAsync` method, we can write back to DynamoDB.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task Post(string city)
{
    var data =  GenererateDummyData(city);
    foreach (var d in data)
        await _dynamoDbContext.SaveAsync(d);
}
private static WeatherForecast[] GenererateDummyData(string city)
{
    var rng = new Random();
    return Enumerable.Range(1, 5).Select(index => new WeatherForecast
        {
            City = city,
            Date = DateTime.UtcNow.Date.AddDays(index),
            TemperatureC = rng.Next(-20, 55),
            Summary = Summaries[rng.Next(Summaries.Length)]
        })
        .ToArray();
}

```

If you want to update an existing item's property, use the `LoadAsync` method to load the Item, update the property, and save it back using the `SaveAsync` method.

```csharp
var todayForecast = await _dynamoDbContext
    .LoadAsync<WeatherForecast>(city, DateTime.Now.Date );
todayForecast.TemperatureC = 20;
await _dynamoDbContext.SaveAsync(todayForecast);

```

Similarly, the `DeleteAsync` method deletes an item by specifying the partition and the range key or the Item itself.

```csharp
[HttpDelete]
public async Task Delete(string city)
{
    await _dynamoDbContext
        .DeleteAsync<WeatherForecast>(city, DateTime.Now.Date);
}

```

There are [more methods available for Batch Get, Batch Write](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DotNetDynamoDBContext.html), etc. that you can explore here.

## DynamoDB API Overview

The Amazon DynamoDB support provided in the AWS SDK for .NET is divided into three layers:

-   Low-Level Interface → found under the namespaces _`Amazon. DynamoDB'and' Amazon.DynamoDB.Model`_. It is the API most closely related to the service model, with little overhead or helper functionality.
-   Document Interface → found under the namespace _`Amazon.DynamoDB.DocumentModel`._ It's an API based around Table and Document classes.
-   High-Level Interface → found under the namespace _`Amazon.DynamoDB.DataModel`._ Easiest to work with .NET classes and is what we used in the code samples above.

Not all functionality is available via the High-Level interface, e.g., to create a new table. In these cases, we will need to fall back to the lower-level APIs.

I hope this helps you to get a basic understanding of DynamoDB and how to get started with it from .NET.

In future posts, I'll show you how to automate creating tables and avoid manual creation. I'll also show how to set up a local development environment using docker and more.
