AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by AWS that allows you to run code without the need to manage servers.

Upload your code to Lambda, and it handles the rest, including scaling and availability.

This blog post is a collection of other posts that covers various aspects of AWS Lambda and other services you can integrate with when building serverless applications on Lambda.

## Getting Started With AWS Lambda

If you are completely new to AWS Lambda and just getting started, check out my getting started article below.

## AWS Lambda Triggers

AWS Lambda Triggers allow you to execute your Lambda function in response to a specific event or trigger. This event-driven architecture allows you to integrate your Lambda functions with other AWS services and execute your code in a serverless environment.

With a variety of triggers available, you can easily build powerful serverless applications that can scale on demand and automatically respond to different types of events.

### DynamoDB Triggers

DynamoDB Triggers allow you to automatically invoke a Lambda function in response to specific actions on a DynamoDB table, such as item updates, inserts, or deletions.

DynamoDB Triggers enable you to build powerful and scalable applications that can automatically respond to changes in your DynamoDB tables without the need for any polling or manual intervention.

### S3 Triggers

Amazon S3 Triggers allow you to automatically invoke a Lambda function in response to specific events on an S3 bucket, such as object creation, deletion, or modification.

With S3 Triggers, you can easily integrate your Lambda functions with your S3 buckets and automate your workflows, making your applications more efficient and reducing the need for manual intervention.

### SQS Triggers

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

SQS Triggers allow you to automatically invoke a Lambda function in response to messages in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.

With SQS Triggers, you can easily integrate your Lambda functions with your SQS queues and build resilient, loosely coupled, fault-tolerant systems.

### SNS Triggers

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to send and receive messages from distributed systems, microservices, and serverless applications.

SNS Triggers allow you to automatically invoke a Lambda function in response to messages published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic.

With SNS Triggers, you can easily integrate your Lambda functions with your SNS topics and build highly responsive and event-driven systems.

## Building APIs with AWS Lambda

There are several ways to build APIs on AWS Lambda, including using API Gateway, Function URLs, and hosting ASP.NET Core Applications.

### Amazon API Gateway

API Gateway provides a fully managed solution for creating and managing RESTful APIs that can be integrated with Lambda functions. It offers a wide range of API management tools and features such as caching, rate limiting, and authentication.

### Function URLs

Function URLs allow you to quickly and easily invoke your Lambda functions over HTTP without the need for any additional infrastructure. This approach is ideal for simple APIs that do not require advanced API management features.

### Hosting ASP.NET Core

Hosting ASP.NET Core applications on Lambda functions enables you to build and deploy full-featured web APIs using familiar development tools and frameworks.

I hope this helps you get a good understanding of AWS Lambda and how to integrate it with other AWS Services from your .NET application.
